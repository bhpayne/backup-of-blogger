    <title>second girlfriend, C2; post-breakup</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks after the breakup we met and talked about the reason I left her. My reasoning (I wanted more experience to better understand how good C2 was) hadn't changed. She left sad/angry, though this wasn't expressed towards me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About 6 weeks after the breakup we had a class together. After the class C2 came over to my house and I made pizza and ice cream. She didn't want to have sex, as she was still feeling angry. She said we might have sex after the anger was dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier the same day I received my first blowjob from K1. I didn't tell C2 I was already dating and having sex with other people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two weeks later C2 spent the night -- she slept in a separate bed at my house. That weekend we went on a two day road trip. No sex due to a medical issue and she was on her period. I asked her what the status of our relationship was and she said it was "in limbo."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
When I'm with C2, I eat more than I otherwise would. I do activities I would otherwise not do and enjoy them simply because I'm with C2.</content>

    <content type='html'>Ode to a romantic [me]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sometimes snore, and I sleep like an "X"/ And you prefer to share the bed only for sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But you stayed with me to make me happy/ And now I'm feeling all mushy and sappy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I didn't get all that much sleep/ You made me so happy I thought I might weep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each time I woke up and you were in the room/ My heart did a joyful boom boom boom</content>

    <title>skillset of a hustler</title>
    <content type='html'>A hustler's skill is in manipulating people to take specific actions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To accomplish this requires both logic and either transfer of emotional state or evoking an emotional response. The reason for the emotional component is to address the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"&gt;halting problem&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't set the emotional bounds for your audience, logic and evidence may lead to different conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A hustler has a negative connotation because they are seen as manipulative. Here manipulative means the person is inducing certain emotional and logic process and they are not being vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When both parties are vulnerable, then the emotional interaction is viewed as a good bond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being emotionally vulnerable means sharing the personal cause suffering.</content>

    <title>Revelation on sex from L1, quickly applied to outing with C4</title>
    <content type='html'>L1 and I have been going out for 3 weeks, and the sex has been great. Our libidos are well matched. With so much sex, we haven't actually talked much. Saturday L1 decided it was time to go for a walk (after sex) and talk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the conversation, L1 asked, "Would you cheat on me?" I laughed and didn't immediately respond, and this (understandably) perturbed L1. They typical response would be an immediate and defensive "no" with no further discussion. Instead, I asked what she meant by cheating. From being with previous girlfriends, I knew I would continue to look at attractive women, even if I was with the hottest. We eventually &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can_Negotiate_Anything"&gt;negotiated&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;b&gt;what we meant by "cheating" was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;sex, kissing, touching ass and touching genitals. Touching boobs is allowed, if it is one time (not on going).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The conversation continued; we gave a quick history of our relationships, with my latest being the last story. One of the reasons I broke up with C2 was because I wanted more sexual experience (so far K1 and L1). L1, not wanting that to be a reason I broke up with her, said &lt;b&gt;I could have sex with other girls while we are in a relationship!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;There are (reasonable) conditions: I would notify L1 in advance, and proper protection against&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection"&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is required. This made me ecstatic, as I didn't want to give up a relationship with L1, and I didn't want to limit myself to three sexual experiences. With this permission, L1 allowed me to satisfy both goals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next day, Sunday, L1 left for vacation. I entertained myself by going to a yoga class with C4. On our previous date (before I met L1), C4 only wanted to talk -- no sex. I wasn't sure whether C4 thought our outing was social or a date, so I told her about my new relationship with L1 once we met up. C4 was disappointed, but continued on with our activities: yoga, meal, then a movie. After the meal, we were both stinky from the hot yoga class. We headed back to C4's place for a shower before the movie. I showered, then C4 said she wanted a massage and wasn't interested in going to a movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My situational awareness had been up all day with C4, and this was the transition point from social outing to attempted intimacy. I told C4 about my conversation with L1 the previous day, and that I would not be having sex with C4. I texted, then called L1 to let her know the situation with C4. By the time I had written out the text, I knew I didn't want to proceed with C4. I let L1 know to go back to her vacation and not worry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C4 wanted to snuggle, which we did in her bed. As protection against progress, I left my shoes on and C4 wouldn't let me fully onto the bed (which was my intention). I did end up giving C4 a quick back massage, but it was a parting gift. I left C4 and drove home. I messaged L1 about the status.</content>

    <title>How I currently judge females, and the unhealthy categories</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;
When I see a girl, I can characterize my instantaneous response into three categories of attraction:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heart stopping&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are three domains for these ratings: her body, her face, and her personality. A girls face is usually the quickest to judge because it's typically not covered. In winter it can be harder to judge a girl's body when covered in multiple layers; during yoga judgement is easier. Personality usually takes longest, as it depends on interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While this isn't as granular as the conventional 1 to 10 numeric, there is some basis for the three categories. By "not attractive," what I mean is that I'd probably have sex with the girl, but it would be only once and I wouldn't want to be associated publicly with the girl. "Decent" implies that I'd want to have sex with the girl repeatedly, and it would be ok to be publicly associated with the girl. Lastly, by "heart stopping" I mean the girl is straight out of my fantasies. I have self doubt over whether I'm worthy of being associated with her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
None of what I describe above sounds healthy, either socially or for my own internal mental state.</content>

    <title>reconcile how I think with what I want</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm interested in intransient observations - laws of physics, mathematics. My time-scale of interest is 1000 years&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm interested in experiencing pleasure, which is transient&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think logically rather than emotionally.</content>

For a first message, not too short and not too long.&lt;br /&gt;
Three sentences&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For responses to her, short is good -- a sentence&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Be Positive&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Don't start with logistics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Be specific&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Avoid generalities&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>notes from socializing as an experiment</title>
    <content type='html'>Last night I attended a social event. A happy hour is not my typical weeknight. It's undirected interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
Driving to the event, I realized I had no plan, no definition of success, and no enthusiasm. I felt a bit anxious, and that I was wasting my time on an activity I don't enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn't worried about my own feeling of value. I had previously asked, "What value are other people to me?" I wasn't able to come up with a good answer for general interactions. The value I get from other people are information, pleasure, and the potential for pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I realized I could flip the question to be, "What value do I provide others?" This yielded a plan: to help others have a good time. My indicator of success: evoke a smile from one person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once at the event, I was able to quickly achieve this success. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eye contact was relatively easy once I knew to focus on it. I was able to observe whether others made eye contact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like finding the odd balls&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't focus on attractiveness&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I need to work on projection&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I fell into the trap of technical conversation. I asked a person I was talking to about the app they were using for their hobby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I focused on facts. A person I was talking to claimed that since she was from Ohio, she didn't have an accent. I didn't believe her, but I let it go. She brought it up again with another person, so I decided to look it up. I even spent the time to find a reputable source,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/state_OH.html"&gt;https://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/state_OH.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Confronting the person about being wrong didn't yield a positive emotional engagement for either party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>reflections on my interactions with L1</title>
    <content type='html'>L1 has my ideal body. I really enjoy sex with L1.&lt;br /&gt;
I am not emotionally or intellectually bonded with L1.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't see L1 as an equal, responsible adult.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't respect L1 as a peer or intellectually or in terms of physical fitness.&lt;br /&gt;
I respect her ability to make choices as an independent adult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What's preventing me from treating L1 as an adult?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
L1 has been medicated 3 times in the past six months:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;car accident&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sex with previous partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday dinner party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
L1's poor decisions cause me to feel frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;
L1 being heavily medicated means I don't get the joyful L1.&lt;br /&gt;
The consequence of poor decision making means I don't get to have unprotected sex for more than two months. This is frustrating when the primary reason we are together is sex.&lt;br /&gt;
Frustration arises because I care about her happiness.&lt;br /&gt;
Why frustration rather than compassion? Because I have attachment to L1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Monogamy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want to have sex with other girls. I want to have emotional relationships with other girls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
L1 insists on having the label of "girlfriend." The associated definition is that I prioritize my attention-time for L1. This label of L1 as my girlfriend hinders other girls from having sex with me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
The label of girlfriend is not relevant to me. I'm not seeking a girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;
L1 is seeking monogamy in the long term. I haven't reached that decision.&lt;br /&gt;
L1's enablement of my activities is driven by her fear of loss if she doesn't let me address my desires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How would my behavior change if L1 were not present?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would find activities I enjoy doing by myself and invite potential girls along. I would use match.com &lt;br /&gt;
I would have and spend more time on my online dating profiles and messaging girls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What do I fear?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a fear of losing access to sex with L1. I have a fear of missing other sexual experience. These are not conflicting - both can be addressed with sufficient time and effort&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Am I growing emotionally?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I see value in participating in a long-term relationship, even if the relationship isn't healthy.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm not taking risks. This lack of risk taking may hinder my emotional bonding&lt;br /&gt;
The emotional imbalance (L1 loves me, the feeling isn't consistently reciprocal) means there is no risk or struggle for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I realize I don't feel emotional draw. I'm not sure whether that is L1 specific or me. I don't know if someone else would cause me to feel and behave differently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I occasionally feel attachment with L1. I feel&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://liveboldandbloom.com/02/relationships/the-insidious-poison-of-disengagement-in-your-relationships"&gt;disengaged&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with L1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;My lack of value for L1 applies generically&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"Acknowledge each person's intrinsic value as a human being. No matter who they are, each person has an intrinsic value that must be recognized and respected by you. When you ignore someone's value as a human being, you basically erase their humanity and any respect that they should be allowed."&lt;br /&gt;
source:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Treat-People-With-Respect"&gt;http://www.wikihow.com/Treat-People-With-Respect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't have respect for L1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why do I respect people generally?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How they think, how they communicate, what they are doing with their life.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't respect people who are fat or bad decision makers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What if I didn't have L1?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would miss the sex, her energy, touch, singing, letting me do what I want when I want.&lt;br /&gt;
Changing my status to single but retaining sex with L1 feels like I'm abusing L1's enablement.</content>

    <title>why I have trouble socializing</title>
    <content type='html'>At work I have no problem socializing. That's because the relations are information based (relying on expertise) and everyone has similar goals (get paid, security, etc).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast, socializing outside of work is hard for me -- relations are not as information-based (more emotion) and goals are unclear or divergent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I have value. The value of other people to me includes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential physical pleasure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical pleasure&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>distinction between a good person and a gentleman</title>
    <content type='html'>I distinguish between "good person" and "gentleman"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A good person is kind and thoughtful&lt;br /&gt;
A gentleman pays for the dinner bill and opens the door&lt;br /&gt;
A person can be a gentleman and a good person, a gentleman and not a good person.&lt;br /&gt;
A gentleman is conventional; I try not to be.&lt;br /&gt;
I try to be a good person&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>advice on poly relationships for the first timer (me)</title>
    <content type='html'>I asked my poly support group what advice they have for a person starting out with a third person in a relationship. There were about 50 people, and as many tips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk talk talk. This was the main point, delivered over and over. Honest communication is paramount. Talk with your primary, talk with your secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk with your primary before, &amp;nbsp;during, &amp;nbsp;after having a third person in the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 people = 4 relationships, 3 people = 9 relationships (n people = n^2 relationships). For the 2 people, there is A --&amp;gt; B, B --&amp;gt; A, A --&amp;gt; A, and B --&amp;gt; B. This is why having multiple partners is more complicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New relationship energy: puppy love, infatuation, etc all occur with a new partner. This can lead to neglect of your primary partner for a limited duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old relationship energy: your relationship with your primary is your foundation. You will come back to and more deeply appreciate this&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to your own feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly check status with your primary. The first answer isn't the final answer. Keep asking the same question until they tell you to stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss details of your interaction: feelings, actions. Be specific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss with primary what level of detail they want to know -- everything, or just the bare minimum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your primary getting out of this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is fishing, not hunting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in frequency can change on both your side and your primary's preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>I have to change to attract the people I seek</title>
    <content type='html'>Attractive girls have little motivation to go outside their routine and standard social circle.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, if I want interaction with attractive girls, I will have to go outside my routine and outside my social circle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want to approach interactions with loving curiosity. I don't currently do this. I'm not sure how to change to this approach. How am I worthy of love? Both my own and the love of other people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently I form emotional bonds with people who I respect and value. Can I reprogram the basis on which I love people?&lt;br /&gt;
Can I expand the reasons why I love beyond respect and value?&lt;br /&gt;
Can I expand my definitions of respect and value?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Physical appearance of the people I want to interact with has some role for my ego. I don't understand how it pertains in my relations.&lt;br /&gt;
I realize my appearance matters because it impacts how other people judge me.</content>

    <title>vasectomy, one month after the surgery</title>
    <content type='html'>It's been about 1 month since my vasectomy, and I'm happy. Happy that I have no pain, happy with the choice I made, and happy I won't be having kids. There is very little noticeable change in the appearance of my ball sack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've been doing vigorous exercise for the past two weeks (kickboxing, aerial yoga, etc) with no problems. Sex is the same as it was prior to the vasectomy, except now without the lingering worry of potential pregnancy. I continue to wear a condom and have not yet had unprotected vaginal sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I haven't had sex with any new partners, but I look forward to the reactions I'll get when I tell females I cannot have kids with them. Kids, or the potential for kids, seem to be an important factor to females for the age range I'm dating.</content>

    <title>being alone and being lonely</title>
    <content type='html'>I can resolve the objectively measurable state of being alone by being with other dynamically responsive, independent people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The subjective feeling of loneliness is not necessarily addressed by the presence of other people being nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loneliness is resolved by a deep sense of emotional connection.</content>

    <title>negotiation process on whether to continue dating L1</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
step 1: individual wants in our relationship&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I want from L1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sex with L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1's positive energy and enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freedom to pursue sex with other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I wants from other girls&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the possibility of relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What L1 wants&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritization over other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stability/security in relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sex with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both L1 and I want&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual happiness for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mutual happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*********************&lt;br /&gt;
step 2: brain storming what opportunities exist for L1 and I:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue current situation; work harder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lie about relationship status to other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lie about status to L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I increase riskiness threshold for sex with other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I become celibate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 and I have a monogamous relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 and I become companions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hires a prostitute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convince friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*********************&lt;br /&gt;
step 3: evaluate opportunities in step 2 against the wants listed in step 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue current situation; work harder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keeps struggling to find sex with other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 struggles with emotional security and relationship stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 is not happy because her existence is limiting I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am dissatisfied because L1 is limiting my search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am dissatisfied because existence of L1 dampens my motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am dissatisfied because existence of L1 takes my time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lose what I wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 loses what she wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;negative impact on both individual and mutual happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lie about relationship status to other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am uncomfortable with this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;possible risk to I's job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lie about status to L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;counter to the ethics of the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am unable to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I increase riskiness threshold for sex with other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential loss of sex for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential loss for L1 of sex with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I become celibate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loss of sex with L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 not as enthusiastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 and I have a monogamous relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lose freedom to pursue other girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lose sex with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I experiences potential loss of individual happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loss of mutual happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L1 and I become companions --&amp;gt; removal of boyfriend/girlfriend status --&amp;gt; therefore I am single; change of status of relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;negative impact on prioritization for L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;negative impact on stability/security for L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;negative impact on individual happiness for L1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hire a prostitute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;illegal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk to my job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convince friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*********************&lt;br /&gt;
step 4: veto and evaluate opportunities&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* [ &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ][ &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ][ &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ] continue current situation; work harder&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Unicorns get away with more shit</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;
This past weekend I had an interesting experience. C5, the girl that my girlfriend and I played with, invited us to have lunch. C5 is living with her current boyfriend and his wife. Thus, lunch was a party of 5 -- me, C5, L1, C5's boyfriend (B1), and B1's wife (!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surprisingly, the interaction wasn't awkward or weird. That's probably due to everyone except L1 and I having years of experience in the polyamory community. There was also a large age gap -- C5 is older than L1 and I by 10 years, and B1 and his wife are 20 years older than L1 and I.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My observations on the situation were&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.morethantwo.com/polyglossary.html"&gt;Unicorns&lt;/a&gt; get away with more shit. Here C5 was the unicorn. C5 organized the lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoy these types of situations because even "idle conversation" requires significant attention. Every interaction is important, even if the content is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A long first date: initial interaction with L1</title>
    <content type='html'>I've had a profile on match.com for a while and have edited it to be both unique and compelling. L1 initially contacted me and we sent a few message back and forth over the course of a week. I've learned how to successfully communicate on e-dating websites (material for a separate post). We moved from match.com to texting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had been flirting with another girl and set up a first date to see a free screening of Back to the Future. This girl flaked the night before, so I contacted L1 to see if she was doing anything Thursday evening. She wasn't, so I invited her to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
L1 was an hour late, but I didn't mind. Movies usually aren't good first dates since there's limited interaction, but it turns out Back to the Future is a romantic comedy. After the movie I walked L1 towards her car. We came to a bench on the sidewalk and she said we should sit and talk since we had not conversed due to the movie. We talked for a while. I eventually asked L1, "Can I ask you an awkward question?" (Yes.) "Can I kiss you?" (Yes). We made out for while on the bench, then talked some more. Before leaving I asked what her plans were for the weekend. She said she might be busy Saturday, but had two tickets for a movie near her house (30 minutes from mine). I invited myself to join her at the movies Friday night. We parted around 1am on Friday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I met up with L1 at the theater near her house (she was late again, though only 10 minutes this time). The movie she had wanted to see was no longer playing, so we decided to walk around the mall. We shopped and I bought a few things. There was a free outdoor concert starting, so we decided to sit and listen. I lay on the grass and took off my shirt. We cuddled for the whole concert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the concert we were slightly hungry so we walked to a nearby steakhouse. I had an appetizer and she ordered an entree. L1 ordered three margaritas, which I interpreted as a good sign. We left at midnight, an hour after the steakhouse closed. L1 was getting pretty horny, so I said I'd take her to my place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My house was under construction, but L1 didn't seem to mind. She came twice, I came and we went to sleep around 4am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was up Saturday at 8am and made some food. L1 got up and we did yoga, ate, shared a bath, and went shopping. More sex even though we were both tired from repeated sleep deprivation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dropped L1 off Sunday morning.</content>

    <title>mindset of interaction participants</title>
    <content type='html'>When two people talk, each person has a mindset of {politeness, curiosity, attraction}, or some combination thereof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each participant may have a different mindset in an interaction: a person feeling attracted may be talking to someone who feels curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The respective mindsets change based on what is said (verbally, through body language, and through actions). A person may feel curiosity, then attracted, then politeness all in a single conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was at a party and made a mistake of not recognizing the mindset of a girl. I had started the process of getting ready to go. A girl started interacting with me, either out of curiosity or attraction. I was focused on grabbing my stuff and exiting, so I engaged with a politeness mindset. She was attractive, so reciprocating with either a curiosity or attracted mindset would have been appropriate.</content>

    <title>feelings and their role in a relationship</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm a guy. I won't go so far as to claim "typical guy" but I share many of the common symptoms. I recognized that I didn't know what "feelings" and "emotions" were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm now in my third intimate relationship [I'm now 31!]. &amp;nbsp;During my second relationship, I figured out that "feelings" refer to physical responses to a situation. Symptoms include increased heart rate, constricted chest. "Emotions" are how these physical reactions effect thinking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the reasons for this lack of development (no progress until about age 30) is that no one asked me about feelings in a meaningful way. Questions like, "How do you feel?" are effectively meaningless when I don't have the vocabulary. Most of the time I don't take the time to notice how by body feels in various situations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I find that noticing my physical response can deepen the effect. My responses are often based on actions, i.e., sex.</content>

    <title>the psychology of having a threesome</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm working on having a threesome. It's not a trivial process; this post is documentation of the journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My girlfriend, L1, gave me permission to have sex with others when we first started dating. She understanding my desire for sexual diversity and experiences. I'm more strongly polyamorous than she is, so this could create a tension. The constraint on my polyamorous tendencies is time -- relationship take a significant amount of work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
L1 and I created a new profile on OKCupid advertising our interest in finding a new partner. After a month, we've received a few responses but had no face-to-face meetings</content>

    <title>What is emotional chemistry in a relationship?</title>
    <content type='html'>a definition of chemistry: you think of and desire someone when they are not present&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
alternative definition of chemistry (aka wavelength) = shared values, humor, communication, interests, goals,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;method for determining chemistry&lt;/i&gt;: Show some emotion and see if the other person is attracted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emotions described verbally without words: "ahhh" to indicate relaxation, "mmm" to indicate interest. Inflection, rate, and duration matter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
emotional chemistry in a relationship also involves being sensual. Non-verbal communication, for example the eyes, touch (specifically caress), smell, are relevant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Focus on sensual (physical sensation) rather than cerebral (thinking).&lt;br /&gt;
Do you blush? Can you find what makes the other person&amp;nbsp;blush?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you smile? Can you find what makes the other person&amp;nbsp;smile?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you laugh? Can you find what makes the other person laugh?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep…wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you’re just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you….The one who turns to his friends and says, ‘that’s her.'"&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>vasectomy, day 1</title>
    <content type='html'>Appointment 1: early February 2014&lt;br /&gt;
co-pay for visit: $30&lt;br /&gt;
met with nurse who took blood pressure, temperature, weight.&lt;br /&gt;
met with doctor who covered description of vasectomy procedure and potential complications, all of which I was familiar with based on my reading.&lt;br /&gt;
Pharmacist gave 1 valium. cost $5.10&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Appointment 2: Friday morning, mid March 2014&lt;br /&gt;
Woke 6:30am. Ate breakfast with C2. We left the house 8:30am. I took my valium in the car at 9am. Checked in at clinic for 10am appointment. Waited until 9:30am, was called into office. Weight (182lbs with shoes), blood pressure, and temperature taken by nurse. Then I was led into an office with a bed. I undressed (left my shirt and socks on) and went to the bathroom. The nurse then shaved my scrotum with an electric trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned off the lights and left the room for about 30 minutes. I felt sleeping, probably the valium taking effect. The doctor came in around 10:10am and the nurse prepped by wiping my nuts with antiseptic. Then the doctor injected a numbing agent with a needle -- actually less painful than donating blood. During the procedure the nurse distracted me with conversation while the doctor concentrated on the operation. Took about 20 minutes per side. A piece of the vas deferens&amp;nbsp;is sent to the lab to ensure the cut is of the correct tube. There was smoke from the cauterizer, but other than that I felt only minor discomfort. I could feel some tugging, but nothing terrible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the procedure was finished, a topical numbing agent was applied and the incisions were sewn shut. I was awake and communicative the whole time. I was very ginger getting off the bed and getting dressed. I wore baggy pants and loose boxers. I was given paperwork explaining the details of follow-up. Swelling and bruising are normal. Grapefruit size or puss are bad signs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I walked out (wide legged stance) and called a cab to take me home. I was extra careful sitting in the cab -- very deliberate and slow movement. I got home and sat on a bag of frozen peas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following the two week resting period, I will need to ejaculate 20 or more times and wait 2 months. Then the semen is inspected to ensure zero sperm are present.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The incisions on both sides of my scrotum are small and the stitches are minor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The weekend after the procedure I went on a roadtrip. I sat on ice part of the time. Instead of walking, I sat in a wheelchair. It was more discomfort rather than pain. There was a small urge to itch the stitches which I resisted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>second girlfriend, C2. Part 1: initial courting</title>
    <content type='html'>After the disastrous first episode with C1, I decided to focus on building a social life and not focus on dating. I built a semblance of a social calendar using meetup.com. I like a variety of events. I volunteered, did fun physical activities, and ended up with a group of aquantiences (not friends). One of the volunteering events I had done a few times was organizing books for a literary charity. After the work, we would go as a group to a nearby restaurant for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At one of these events I brought my parents, who were in town visiting. C2 was also there and talked with my parents. I didn't think anything of it at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I volunteered at the same place again, talked with C2 after the lunch, and later sent a "Good to meet you" to C2 (part of the features on meetup.com). She interpreted this as a sign I liked her. She replied with an email, leading to her asking if I wanted to get together by suggesting a few options for activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We dated, finding a variety of activities through meetup. We went to dancing lessons, karaoke, and parties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of mid-November, no sex or even kisses, just hugs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
I still had no idea what I was doing; this was my second girlfriend. I didn't know what to expect or how to act. I simply did what I thought I would enjoy, hoping C2 would join me. I had no long term plans. It was simply, "what are we doing next together?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt no urgency to have sex. She was not unattractive, but not what I would have otherwise been interested in. I had no motivation to talk to her, but it wasn't bad talking to her. I felt no lust; I was just happy to have a female to talk to one-on-one.</content>

    <title>match.com response rates</title>
    <content type='html'>I previously posted about &lt;a href="http://datingfailurelessons.blogspot.com/2016/12/im-measurably-above-average-in-response.html"&gt;my messaging response rate from OKCupid&lt;/a&gt;. I recently joined match.com and can now compare the two dating services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Dec 26 to Dec 28 (2 days) I messaged 23 unique users and got replies from 3 unique users. It's too early to have a good ensemble, but that's 13%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The incentives on match.com are a bit different -- for guys there's a minimum of messaging 5 unique users per month to get their guarantee. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another distinction for match is that you get to see which messages that you've sent have been read.</content>

    <title>notes from sociologist studying poly</title>
    <content type='html'>Source: 20 year longitudinal study&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bias: participants in longitudinal study are more likely to be engaged in positive relationships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically experience is that poly evolves&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people want multiple partners and want those partners to be exclusive to them&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Advantages of consensual non monogamy&lt;br /&gt;
* Getting more needs met, primarily socially (emotionally) and sexually&lt;br /&gt;
* novelty&lt;br /&gt;
* stronger social support&lt;br /&gt;
* personal growth through addressing challenges&lt;br /&gt;
* poly effective relationships - deep emotional bond only ( similar to sibling bonding )&lt;br /&gt;
* responsibility diffusion&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;
* complexity of logistics, finances, emotional&lt;br /&gt;
* social stigma&lt;br /&gt;
* time used communication&lt;br /&gt;
* time spent introspecting, ie boundaries&lt;br /&gt;
* perception that poly means no boundaries&lt;br /&gt;
* more drama due to more people involved&lt;br /&gt;
* over use of veto power leading to resentment&lt;br /&gt;
* dislike of your partner's partner&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coming out lessons&lt;br /&gt;
* figure out why you want to come out to a specific person&lt;br /&gt;
* before coming out to family, make sure you are financially independent &amp;nbsp;(ie tuition, inheritance)&lt;br /&gt;
* choose an event where there's no pre existing emotional stress, limited audience, and focus isn't on someone else&lt;br /&gt;
* give time for the audience to react&lt;br /&gt;
* don't lead up with a negative (ie shameful) impression.&lt;br /&gt;
* poly is a choice you are making; it's not a reflection on the other person&lt;br /&gt;
* use a less sensitive topic to lead to the relevant topic&lt;br /&gt;
* not coming out can be a reasonable choice. The action can be delayed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jealousy&lt;br /&gt;
* Jealousy isn't necessarily an indicator there's something wrong&lt;br /&gt;
* it's a relevant and reasonable emotion.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;It can be legitimate&lt;br /&gt;
* determine the source (often based on fear of loss)&lt;br /&gt;
* practice self soothing. How do you have fun?&lt;br /&gt;
* cultivate independence&lt;br /&gt;
* fear of loss of being special&lt;br /&gt;
* Jealousy can be over non-sexual aspects&lt;br /&gt;
* the responsibility of addressing Jealousy is with all parties involved. May benefit from counseling&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jealousy can be due to lack of &amp;nbsp;respect and attention&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jealousy can be due to your issues, the other person's behavior, or history&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>A negotiated breakup: how I view our relationship after two years</title>
    <content type='html'>I've been in a relationship with L1 for more than 2 years. During that entire time we've been in an open relationship. The motivation for having an open relationship is so that I can pursue my desire to have sex with other girls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One significant reason L1 consented to this when we first met was because she had a similar experience with her first boyfriend. She was happy with her first boyfriend, but wanted to have other relationship and sexual experiences rather than simply commit to the first person she had been with. The way she and her first boyfriend handled this was that she broke up with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than break up with me, L1 has participated in my exploration process. That has been an amazing and unusual experience. I've had relationships with other girls, though no actual sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I value my relationship with L1. She's my ideal physically -- a perfect body. She has a lot of positive energy (ie singing to the radio, enthusiasm). We both have high libidos. We value health and athleticism. The fact that L1 allows me to pursue other girls while maintaining a long term relationship is amazing. I desire a limited amount of interaction (ie only weekends, limited phone contact during the week), and L1 is willing to do this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we first met, I wanted to use the label "companions" to describe our relationship. L1 didn't accept that; she wanted the label of boyfriend and girlfriend. I consented to that. For L1, boyfriend and girlfriend as labels have emotional weight. The labels do not for me, though I am aware of their cultural connotation. My interest in using the "companion" label was intentionally to avoid the cultural weight of a significant investment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although there many positive aspects to my relationship with L1, there are some gaps. L1 has strong emotions for me, and I don't reciprocate. I rarely feel any emotions, so this isn't an issue with me that is specific to L1. Second, I've grown complacent with L1 -- I appreciate her, but my interactions are routine. We do new things, enjoy each other's company, discover new aspects of our relationship, and are growing, but we also fall into ruts. Third, I don't respect L1. I suspect that this lack of respect hinders development of emotional engagement on my part. Lack of respect is not specific to L1 -- I respect very few people. The people I do respect earn it based on how they think, how they communicate, and what they are doing with their life.&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type='html'>The above points are valid -- it is what I want from L1

Interestingly, what I didn&amp;#39;t include in my wants:
* to respect and value L1
* to develop an emotional bond with L1

What I&amp;#39;m looking for in a partner: I want to respect/cherish/admire/value that person
The reason I respect a person currently is 
* brilliant
* doing something unusual
* passionate

How I want to view other people in general: with respect value them </content>

    <title>tips for good conversation</title>
    <content type='html'>Pay attention to your surroundings (situational awareness). You can then comment on features of your environment.&lt;br /&gt;
Apply a sense of curiosity about your surroundings. This curiosity extends to the people around you and the stories they tell. People usually like to talk once someone (you) provide contextually-pertinent questions. Positive outcomes are (1) you learn more about the person and (2) you might learn something new.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all topics are conventionally acceptable in all situations. "Social calibration" is situational awareness applied to social relations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stimulating conversation is about provoking an emotional response. One way to do this is to challenge the claims made by others. Problem solving is another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each conversation has a purpose whether you know what that purpose is or not. It is helpful to know why you are talking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoy making predictions about my environment and then testing them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am direct. This requires that I know what I want.</content>

    <title>I want to understand humans</title>
    <content type='html'>My interest in other people is to learn how they think. Do this by listening to individuals talk vulnerably&lt;br /&gt;
The value of other people to me is I can learn from their choices, decision process, experiences&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's hard for me to build rapport with a person who has poor communication skills. By poor communication skills, I'm focusing on both listening and speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As an example, unsolicited talking is typically not good. </content>

    <content type='html'>Did your parents argue? About what? How has that impacted you and your relationships?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is most exciting in our interaction?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you could imagine a future source of conflict between us, what would it be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
How to you interact with money (savings, retirement, debt)?&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>reflection on where I am with respect to intimate relationships, 2016</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;What drives me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have an (intellectual, perhaps cultural) expectation of sexual and intimate experience&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My desire causes me to suffer. As a result I'm not content.&lt;br /&gt;
I intentionally neglected to address the issue for 20 years&lt;br /&gt;
I suspect I cannot satisfy the desire, nor would it be good to suppress&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the desire, there is a time constraint. Third factor driving me is fear of becoming a neurotic old man&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suspect there are two potential outcomes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reach some end state called success&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am always like this, though with decreasing capacity to act on my desire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a lot of evidence that the second is typical&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Importance of appearance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Physical appearance matters to me for two reasons lust and my ego&lt;br /&gt;
Having a hot girlfriend strokes my ego, makes socializing easier, provides a source of reliable sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have an acquaintance who is physically attractive to me, but that's the only value she has to me. I won't be having sex with her, so the only thing I can do is stare. I don't like the feeling of being the creeper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What I don't know: pace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Once a girl shows any willingness to spend time with me, I don't know what pace for escalating towards sex is acceptable&lt;br /&gt;
Pace refers to the rate at which conventional order of operations is carried out - name, touch, kiss, grope, sex&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What I find attractive&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not wanting more than you have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconventional thinking and behavior&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical body, face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want in a partner: sex, physical attraction, inspiring, value&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On a trip out of the country I observed that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hot girls with the body type similar to my current girlfriend exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applies to a range of ages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What I want in life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happiness - different from contentment or pleasure. Happiness is having a genuine smile not derived from current situation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning - topics that interest me, &amp;nbsp;ie how humans work. More specifically, how to get attractive women to want to have sex with me&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local decrease of suffering - relationships that are genuine&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global decrease of suffering&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pleasure with attractive girls fits in both learning and happiness and local decrease of suffering&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am not struggling. Struggle = work hard in order to compensate for the risk of not achieving a goal.&lt;br /&gt;
My lack of struggle is because I don't know what success is for sex. I don't think it is a number.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Leveraging my social network&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My circle of friends from Meetup are reliable adults, physically fit, financially stable, educated, mostly single, responsible, reliable. While these are all good, it's not what I desire.&lt;br /&gt;
My social circles (yoga, social meditation, meetup) have lots of attractive females. However, sex with any of them seems unlikely&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /&gt;How to proceed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I should try being in a relationship in which I take risk. This might evoke emotion&lt;br /&gt;
The risk is that I get hurt emotionally&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Action to take: more effort with dating websites: Okcupid, Match, Craigslist &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Bars and clubs don't leverage my strengths.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't like to dance, drink, or be subjected to loud music&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, the people who frequent bars and clubs are not who I'm seeking</content>

    <title>reflections on what I've observed in my polyamorory experience</title>
    <content type='html'>Monogamous people participate in poly, they just don't call it that. A mother loves her husband and her son and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Poly discussion groups are biased towards people who like to talk.&lt;br /&gt;
It can be difficult to provide value for each participant due to the complexity of interactions and varying degrees of experience and education&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Acting single in the world of dating feels disingenuous&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am unable to manage a vee relationship. A triad seems more reasonable&lt;br /&gt;
Vee can be either balanced (A and B are equals) or imbalanced (A has higher priority than B)&lt;br /&gt;
From an ethics perspective,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A knows of B, B knows of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A doesn't know of B, B knows of A&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A doesn't know of B, B doesn't know of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A knows of B, B doesn't know of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am only comfortable with the first situation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>second girlfriend, C2; second breakup</title>
    <content type='html'>Last Sunday (a week ago) C2 emailed me recent test results showing she had a sexually transmitted infection (STI). She suspects she got the infection about 16 years ago. We had been having sex since November, and as recently as a few days prior to this notice (total time of 5 months). Here "sex" means both protected vaginal sex and unprotected oral sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was emotionally devastating to me on multiple levels. One reason I hadn't sought sex until I was in my thirties was because I disliked the thought of getting STIs since middle school. I had been tested for STIs and come up negative, as had C2. I had been tested for Chlamydia, Gonorrhoeae, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. It turns out Herpes 1 and 2 isn't normally tested for by my health care provider (neither is HIV).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another reason for my distress was that after this first breakup with C2 I had sex with another girl, K1. Again, protected vaginal sex and unprotected oral sex. I let K2 know about my potential exposure within a few hours of the notice from C2. Neither I nor K1 showed symptoms of Herpes, but we both got tested the quickly (Tuesday). Neither K1 nor I have received test results yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I spoke with K1 Friday and she was angry at me but still able to talk with me. K1 wanted to know if we would continue to be friends and I said yes. K1 still wants to be with me, but I don't enjoy being with her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C2 claims she was in denial about the Herpes-2 infection since the relationship in which she got it was drama-filled, albeit 16 years ago. The test results she sent me were from Wednesday, a few days prior to her telling me. I have no idea with C2 communicated this issue to previous sex partners. It's not clear to me whether C2 will tell future sex partners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I went with C2 to an event. We discussed our revelations from the past week. I told C2 I had figured out what made me happy with her: sex. Thus, her having an STI has two outcomes: either I test positive for Herpes-2 and continue to have sex with her, or I test negative and do not have sex with her. I am unwilling to continue to expose myself to the potential for infection. I enjoy being friends with her, but not to the degree if exclusivity that she desired.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Late yesterday C2 sent me an email explaining what I was willing to provide (friendship, sex) were not sufficient for her. She's effectively looking for the American Dream of stable husband, raising kids, etc. I'm not willing to compromise on these issues. She says remaining friends causes her too much emotional harm, so she will try to stop seeing me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This indicates to me a failure of my negotiation skills. I have something she desires (sex, company), and she can provide what I'm looking for (sex, company), yet she doesn't want to be together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My guess is that I don't have Herpes-2 (I show no symptoms), so this lack of C2 in my future isn't the end of the world. I will continue to look for attractive female friends, some of whom may become sex partners. If I test negative I'll be happy, but either way I'll be more vigilant about getting tested for all STIs, and requiring full STI results from potential sex partners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I spoke with my sister about this topic and we agreed there is insufficient discussion about STIs in the United States. It's not part of the cultural norm to raise this topic, and it makes people uncomfortable. I've yet to see a popular romance movie or book which includes STIs or even testing for STIs.</content>

Craigslist&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her:&lt;br /&gt;
"Hello would love to hear that you are real....please let me know if you are :&lt;br /&gt;
dolldiva63@gmail.com"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me:&lt;br /&gt;
"Are you real?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;MY NAME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her:&lt;br /&gt;
"Hey nice to hear back from you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
can you send any pics to this email? Would love to see..... so you are looking for something casual here right? I dont wanna a serious boyfriend or anything lol&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You got any plans... wanna meet up somewhere?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ATTACHMENT: picture of partially naked girl&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me:&lt;br /&gt;
"Casual sounds good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm free all day. Tomorrow I'll be at the beach with my friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;MY NAME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her:&lt;br /&gt;
"feels good to hear back from you again i guess you aren't just a keyboard warrior lol :) Lots of guys on craigslist are nothing but talk it seems....they probably all live at home with their parents lol.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
so when you wanna meet up? I have no plans we can do this whenever you want even right now cause Im just watching episodes of that show breaking bad....love this show its so crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first I really was kinda worried about posting on craigslist cause I had a scary experience a year ago meeting someone from personals (I had to call for help he was crazy) so just to be on the safe side I'd like you to do a quick verify on this page: http://verifiedmeeting.com/sarahbabez&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They protect members and keep out offenders and people with felonies....it does cost a dollar but thats it for the verification and as long as you're not in their database you're getting my number and calling me tonight. Have you seen this before? Its been featured on the news many times. :) I just need you to do this for my peace of mind the first time considering the kinds of guys who might be on craigslist....I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm gonna wait for you to call or text... you'll have to use the link above to get it - thats all I need to know you can be trusted. I really hope you aren't just talk and follow through cause I've been excited about trying out a friend with benefits. Just keep it real with me and don't get clingy k.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ATTACHMENT: picture of naked girl&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me:&lt;br /&gt;
"I don't use the verification sites. I'll be at a public beach tomorrow with friends - you can text me if you want to join."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her:&lt;br /&gt;
"As long as you verify you are safe on that website then we are meeting up and the fun begins... this only costs a dollar and theres nothing after that I just need to make sure you are who you say... otherwise Id have to try someone else who can prove they are trustworthy. If you have nothing to hide and youre safe, then use this page and complete the online verification its really easy and once youve done that call me they will give you my number.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can do this in less then a minute they don't need your life story or anything crazy .Please dont make excuses us women have to play it safe and then me and you can play together. K?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heres the page go here - http://verifiedmeeting.com/sarahbabez"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her:&lt;br /&gt;
"okay I understand if you really don't have a card or whatever...... there is another site which just asks for email and name its this one here: http://nsagirlprofile.com/sammipage69&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They also do screening of their members so what you can do is go on there then send me your number and I'll call you. Once I see your msg on there I'l know you passed their screening my username is vballbabe27.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
okay i'm gonna close my email up for now.... message me on there when you are ready and give me your number.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>escalating an interaction: vulnerability, romantic interest, sexual interest</title>
    <content type='html'>Approaching a girl with romantic or sexual interest is outside of the social convention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even after approaching, conventional safe conversation is not emotional escalation. Escalation with a girl is outside of social convention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"convey sexual intent to the girl by showing her in some way, that you have sexual interest in her, that you see her as a sexual woman... Hold eye contact and talk slow and sexy. Something that conveys sexual interest and intent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that tells the woman that you’re confident enough to go after her. And that’s what a woman wants to see in a man, confidence to go for what he wants."&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.seductionscience.com/2011/ways-to-be-a-sexy-man/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Physical escalation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example: talk to "her normally, but you massage her back. Or you throw up a compliment in the very beginning.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>two observations two years into a relationship</title>
    <content type='html'>Maintaining independence while also maintaining close connection with a partner is a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This challenge manifests for me in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my partner is my source of pleasure; I haven't cultivated alternative sources of pleasure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have neglected to define my own purpose independent of my relationship with my partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>role of touch in focusing my awareness</title>
    <content type='html'>Sensuality is about awareness of your senses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Touch focuses my &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drishti_(yoga)"&gt;drishti&lt;/a&gt; to be here, now, and focused on who I'm present with.</content>

    <title>what I want; reproducibility</title>
    <content type='html'>I realized I don't need more activity partners, or social acquaintances. I am looking for people I respect, value, or are badasses. And physically attractive girls to date.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I find sexy: being vulnerable, self compassionate, confident, good communicator, introspective&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given that set of objectives, how could I accomplish this? The only thing I could think was to go to unusual venues and play the numbers game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I met a girl that reset my perspective. She was outside of my conception of what to expect. In terms of my OODA loop, she was beyond my model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had previously found people that I respect, people that I valued, people who were badasses, and hot girls. This girl is all of this. And she wants to interact with me. This caused me to to experience the difference between a girl that is hot and a girl that his beautiful. The flood and variety of positive emotions is immense. Anxiety of "What if I fuck this up?" mixed with the excitement of, "She wants to interact with me?!"&lt;br /&gt;
The physical manifestation of the anxiety is "stomach flip-flopping" rather than a knot in the stomach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Figuring out what causes this reaction would be useful, because then I would know what to seek in future interactions with other people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**********&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her thinking is vulnerable and unconventional.&lt;br /&gt;
She's intellectually curious and interested in exploring emotional aspects.&lt;br /&gt;
She is a badass. Non-standard experiences.&lt;br /&gt;
She's a superb communicator.&lt;br /&gt;
introspective&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want to disrupt her expectations while ensuring she feels safe and secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
********&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I ask an unconventional question to someone, there response options are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feel uncomfortable and not willing to engage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk at length and not say anything of personal value. The confusing part is that the words they use have meaning, but not as strung together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curiosity, desire to learn more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have previously thought about this and have insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>selection bias in dating choices</title>
    <content type='html'>I first realized this selection bias when I started using OKCupid. The people on OKCupid are there for a few potential reasons&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too busy to find potential mates in real life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insufficiently social to have a choice of mates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sufficiently physically unattractive that no one desires them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not socially assertive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criterion for mate are too selective or are self-contradictory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
None of these are positive reasons to be on an online dating site. The attractive, functionally normal people have less difficulty in finding potential mates in real life because they are attractive and functionally normal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
There are two results of this selection bias. First, it is hard to find attractive, functionally normal people on online dating websites. Second, the fact that I'm using an online dating service means I'm not attractive and functionally normal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People with larger and stronger social networks have an easier time both directly and through friends. &amp;nbsp;Online dating indicates smaller and weaker social networks&lt;br /&gt;
It's not just the number of people you are exposed to. &amp;nbsp;The people you hang out with are likely to be more compatible before you even meet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A way to counteract this bias is to grow your social network. More social activities with more people. &amp;nbsp;Meaningful relationships which cross social sphere boundaries&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Solo meditation, &amp;nbsp;video gaming do not build healthy relationships. Further, &amp;nbsp;video games are mostly shooting or racing. &amp;nbsp;These aren't just time syncs, they're anti social.&lt;br /&gt;
No social training&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>respecting others and finding value in others</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Observation&lt;/i&gt;: In order to form emotional bonds with another person, it may be helpful to respect and value the person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Claim&lt;/i&gt;: respect and value can be an individual basis, or all humans in general, or all living creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; margin: 0px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt;
I do respect a few people. The traits that cause me to feel this are brilliant, communicate effectively, are passionate, and are doing something unusual with their life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I surveyed a couple friends to understand why they respect other people. Two responses I got:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value people because each person has some wisdom based on their life experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value people because they have some aspect of me in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another response was more nuanced: Respect differences in others. Separately, each person has potential value, even if unrealized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>my jargon for dating and relationship</title>
    <content type='html'>Caveat&lt;br /&gt;
I'm a male, so these are with regards to females&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
stranger: a person you haven't met.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
acquaintance: a person you have met but haven't become familiar with. You may know them by sight or even name, but you don't know much about them outside the role you interact with them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
friend: a person you know in multiple social roles. You have interacted sufficiently to know about them&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
good friend: a person you can call if you have a flat tire and need help&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
girl friend: For a male, you are not sleeping with this person but would if given the chance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
companion: For a male, this is a girl with whom you are friends and you have sex with&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
girlfriend: For a male, this is a girl you are exclusively and explicitly committed to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
spouse: Long term exclusive contractual agreement&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
love:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust that I can be vulnerable with you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enjoying you as a whole person. Accepting your faults and your positive aspects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>I don't know what seduction and teasing are</title>
    <content type='html'>I realized that I don't know how to seduce a girl, or how to tease a girl to increase sexual tension.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attraction: be sexy in appearance, actions, environment, social&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seduction: increase sexual attraction&lt;br /&gt;
Teasing: Teaser has the power, the teased feels desire.&lt;br /&gt;
Foreplay&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analytical is for problem solving. Not useful for establishing relationship&lt;br /&gt;
ask open-ended questions&lt;br /&gt;
Engage creatively&lt;br /&gt;
What are you passionate about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Seduction&lt;/h3&gt;
Stimulate emotional reaction&lt;br /&gt;
Engage and pay attention&lt;br /&gt;
Play with boundaries to evoke response&lt;br /&gt;
Appearance matters&lt;br /&gt;
Stimulus should be tailored to the person&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a conversation with only your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
use short, slow responses&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Why would a girl want to have sex?</title>
    <content type='html'>Why would a girl want to have sex?&lt;br /&gt;
Why would a girl want to have sex with me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Asking the direct question "Do you want to have sex with me?" Yields: No&lt;br /&gt;
Because the risk of negative outcome is high.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Create a sequence of questions which get a "yes" response and build in the direction I'm seeking&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to have fun?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you trust me?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you find me attractive?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you feel at ease around me?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you interested in me sexually?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to touch me?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want me to touch you?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you enjoy physical pleasure?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to gaze into my eyes?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to share your desires and fears with me?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to kiss me?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to spend time with me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sex is likely an emotional decision. What emotional state leads to that action?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_desire"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_desire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Flirting is a behavior, and its purpose is to create sexual tension.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_in_decision-making"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_in_decision-making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Induce arousal&lt;br /&gt;
Touch, smell, visual&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>second girlfriend, C2; first sex</title>
    <content type='html'>The turning point in the relationship with C2 was about two weeks after we had met, 4 or 5 dates in. We went to a Thanksgiving party, which ended late. We headed back to her house and she invited me to stay at her place (which I hadn't been to before). I said "sure." Luckily I had taken to carrying condoms in the dash of of my car, which I brought in with me on the off chance we got frisky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I had no expectation of actually having sex. I expected to sleep on the couch. However, once we were inside she said, "no, not the couch. You're sleeping in my bed." I took this to mean she was sleeping on the couch. Instead, once I was in the bed in my boxers she joined me. This was exciting. I was now looking forward to my first snuggling! After some warm up, I made up my mind and when down on her. "Not that bad" was my initial thought after she guided me to the correct spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got the condom on with no problem and we had sex. However, when she rode me I lost my erection because the feeling was so different from masturbation. She didn't know I had lost my virginity until afterwards when we talked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next day I headed to Philadelphia with her. We ended up staying there for a long weekend. We got together well and I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our schedules were busy and we were a 30 minute drive apart, so we spent weekends together and rarely a weeknight. I got better at sex but still wasn't ejaculating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For Christmas was did a roadtrip. I was finally able to come during sex.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>direct versus indirect communication</title>
    <content type='html'>I was previously very goal oriented -- set a big goal, break it into small goals, develop plans to accomplish the series of small goals. Recently I've changed my way of thinking to use intentions rather than goals. Another way of phrasing this shift is having a direction, rather than a destination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I generally think of my communication style as direct (others may say blunt). This is probably based on my lack of caring what others think, aka empathy. Directness in communication is well suited for being goal oriented, and I disdained indirect communication -- chatting, small talk, and other "meaningless" conversation. Either you had a goal and were moving towards it, or you are wasting your (and my) time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the change in thinking in terms of goals to now having intention, there is a corresponding change in how I value different communication styles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some topics I categorize as indirect have value, even if that value is initially unknown. Examples of this would be, "Did you sleep well?" This question can yield information on the person's level of irritability and can help explain future actions and decisions. Similarly, "How are you feeling today?" can be used to predict how that person interacts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other topics in a similar vein are past life experiences, future plans, likes, dislikes. Seemingly simple, useless questions like, "Where are you from?" and "How is your family?" can be emotionally relevant, as these factors affect the person's well-being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When posing these questions, use reciprocal disclosure to increase relationship strength. This reciprocal disclosure of shared intimacy (decreasing privacy) builds trust.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>I'm measurably above average in response rate on OKCupid!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;From this article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;https://theblog.okcupid.com/https-medium-com-okcupid-what-to-send-in-a-first-message-on-a-dating-site-c06ada24547c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;there are two important stats:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;Saying “hey” in a first message ... has an 84% chance of being completely ignored, according to a 2015 OkCupid data report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;--&amp;gt; 16% chance of reply if a message is sent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;messages containing the golden 40–90 characters ...increase your chances of a reply by ...2%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sewlljoai7qblhd" style="color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sewlljoai7qblhd" style="color: #222222; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
--&amp;gt; longer messages have a 18% chance of reply&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
I always write personalized messages that are at least 2 or 3 sentences. And I make sure to ask questions, not just make statements.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
I sent messages to 201 unique OKCupid users between Sept 4 and Dec 25, or 112 days. That's an average of 1.8 new women messaged per day. I cluster my OKCupid activity so that it's bursty.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
I received replies from 38 of those users, a ratio of 18.9%&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of these replies, I've gotten a single date and a phone call with a different girl.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>online dating - lack of success</title>
    <content type='html'>&amp;nbsp;I've used 3 dating websites: plentyoffish, okcupid, and match.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was on pof and okcupid for 2 years. Pof yielded almost no interaction and certainly no results of face to face meetings. Okcupid. &amp;nbsp;resulted in my first date ever. I wasn't proactive on either site as far as sending messages. I&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was using only free sites and every since I joined match.com, which is a pay site. I've had more contacts, both initiated by girls and initiated by me, on match in in one week than all my time on okcupid and pof.</content>

    <title>my first date: C1</title>
    <content type='html'>C1, my first girlfriend, initiated contact with me through OKCupid. We had a total of about five dates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For our first date we met for dinner at a restaurant near my house. When she first walked in, I immediately observed she wasn't beautiful. She was white and thin with blonde hair, but not attractive. However, I wasn't about to complain as she had the gumption to initiate contact with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For one date we met for dinner near her house, which I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For another date we played a board game she liked. I don't like board games and I didn't enjoy playing the game with her. We went for a walk, and she intentionally found a dark isolated spot to kiss me. This was my first kiss -- I didn't see it coming based on context or conversation topic. My legs shook, and I sprung a boner which I pressed into her nervously. I had no idea what was expected, and trading saliva was weird but a turn on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For our last date we ate at my house, a meal I cooked. Afterwards we adjourned to the living room, which had no furniture -- just carpet. I went to the bathroom, and when I got back C1 was laying on the floor. This was like a fantasy that I hadn't even thought of yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We kissed (me being very hesitant) and I didn't touch her body. I had no idea what the boundaries were. She said, "I'm getting cold." I said "Just a minute, I'll turn up the heat." I got up and walked over to the thermostat, turning it up a few degrees. C1 left almost immediately, saying she had an appointment to get to. I said goodnight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn't contact me after that, which I didn't think anything of until 6 months later. &amp;nbsp;I finally came to the realization that she had wanted to have sex!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I year later she was on a hike that I was also on. We greeted each other, but I was very nervous. I noticed a few months later she had viewed my OKCupid profile. I emailed her, but she said she was busy. I interpret this as her version of "no".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
During one of our conversations, she talked about her previous relationships. They were mostly with mathematicians and scientists. I was another in the series of nerds; she was a nerd groupie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In retrospect, this wasn't bad from my perspective -- little work, low cost investment, great learning experience. I feel sorry for C1 as she must have been disappointed by my zero experience and initiative.</content>

    <title>observations accumulated from romantic interactions</title>
    <content type='html'>The idea of exclusivity is related to security in the stories we tell little girls&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jealousy is wanting something you can't have&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I optimize on happiness. That includes both my happiness, and the happiness of those I choose to surround myself with. I don't enjoy hanging out with negative people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Exclusivity of a male partner matters to girls because sharing the guy with other girls could potentially result in the guy leaving if he finds someone better. Therefore, exclusivity is related to security. The girl wants to shut off the male's options regarding other females.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I endorse this blog post on love:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blog.carsieblanton.com/post/82149148832/casual-love" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" target="_blank"&gt;http://blog.carsieblanton.com/&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;post/82149148832/casual-love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is insufficient discussion of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and testing in the US. American cultural norms are not comfortable with STIs, as demonstrated by the lack of inclusion in romance movies and books.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>a stable, healthy, long term relationship versus my (biological?) attraction for sex</title>
    <content type='html'>I am currently in a wonderful, fulfilling relationship that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went to the beach recently. I found I was attracted to females who fit my ideal type. While not surprising biologically, it was surprising emotionally.</content>

    <title>rules for interaction don't exist</title>
    <content type='html'>I used to seek enumeration of the rules for interaction between individuals and the wider society.&lt;br /&gt;
I've come to realize that all rules outside those imposed by physics are arbitrary. While learning what the societal rules are and what interpersonal conventions exists, my actions are now guided by my interests.</content>

    <title>Craigslist casual encounter postings</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm exploring the use of Craigslist to find women to date. I'm primarily using w4m. I've sent about 100 in the past 2 weeks. Five "real people" responded with 1 duplicate (so just 4).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I try to write personal messages when possible, but typically there's not enough content to respond to meaningfully. I use a template which has evolved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Original template message&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;Howdy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;I'm a &amp;lt;three letter acronym describing me&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;town&amp;gt;. I'm &amp;lt;age&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;height&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;weight&amp;gt; lbs. Athletic build due to lots of &amp;lt;activity&amp;gt;. Drug and disease free; recent STI results available and looking for same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;The picture of me is from my recent trip to Greece. I met this girl in a hostel and we toured around the island of Santorini.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This has evolved to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;Howdy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>after the breakup with L1</title>
    <content type='html'>My girlfriend of 2.5 years broke up with me more than a month ago. She broke up with me on a Friday. After she broke up with me we had sex and went to a party; same on Saturday. During the weekend we were both experiencing sadness. The emotion was strange since we were also spending time together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After breaking up we continued to have sex. That's decreased now that she got a new boyfriend, so the full impact is now hitting me. I lost a sex partner. I lost a person I spent a lot of time talking to, and touching, and planning activities, and addressing differences. My routine is disrupted. Each of these losses factors into my current mood. Not a severe depression, but a melancholy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This also has led me to question myself as an individual. Now that I'm not defined as "in a relationship," I have to determine who I am and what I want.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A nuance that I didn't expect: I miss the comfort of knowing sex is going to happen in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I wasn't restricted during my relationship with L1, I now look at hot girls more closely.</content>

    <title>RE: Why are there so many male nudists?</title>
    <content type='html'>Reposted from a forum:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A combination of many things, some more relevant in the past, some more so now. In no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Women's body shame: evil. From the Adam and Eve story on, women's bodies have been seen as something tempting, magical, and needing control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Women's body shame: imperfection. Images of beautiful women, in art and advertising, set a standard a real body can seldom meet. This has begun happening to men only in the past few decades, and still affects women much more strongly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Safety. If a woman is harassed or worse, bad enough, and if she "must have done something" to bring it on, she gets not even moral support in most quarters. And women are vastly more likely to be harassed and assaulted than men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Men's visual sexuality: Nudity matters more to men; even genuinely nonsexual nudity creates a bit of libidinal buzz for guys that it just doesn't, for women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Internet unreality / voyeurism: When men's genuinely nonsexual nudity isn't so nonsexual, after all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6. Male shared experience: Within the lifetimes of older nudists, men were encouraged, even required, to share collective nudity in &amp;nbsp;sport and the military.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7. Women "giving it away": A revealing of the female body can be used as a bargaining chip, and when offered unrestrictedly, can be attacked, by women, as what is essentially unfair competition. And nudity, once familiar, ceases to be sexy, and that can be experienced as a loss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8. Menstruation: Starting at the same time other body-shame issues begin to arise, and generally managed with covering up, complicates female nudity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9. The gender-imbalance death spiral: An open nudist community will tend to start with more men, for the reasons above; most of those people will be heterosexual, and the arithmetic (let alone numbers 3, 4, and 5 above) dictates that the women will be under a certain degree of pressure, which many will find unwelcome. This reduces the number of women, which in turn exacerbates the problem.</content>

    <title>negative effects of porn</title>
    <content type='html'>I never thought I'd write a post against porn, but here goes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I grew up on porn. I consumed large amounts between the ages of 15 and 30. I watched porn daily and&amp;nbsp;masturbated, on average, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;
Math:&amp;nbsp;15 minutes*2*365*15 years/60 =&amp;nbsp;2737.5 hours!&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn't social and didn't have a girlfriend during that time. I was conscious during this that I was addressing my thirst by porn rather than social interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I now stopped watching porn. I have friends and a girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;
The aftereffects persist. I still fantasize about my favorite porn. I am no longer clear on what I enjoy versus what I watched.</content>

    <title>second girlfriend, C2; the breakup</title>
    <content type='html'>C2 was interested in an exclusive long term relationship with the potential for kids. I didn't want that, and this is the source of our eventual breakup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had relatively open and direct conversations. I or C2 would open the discussion with "Awkward question, ..." The recipient would then deal with the question without being offended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We traded "instruction manuals" each of us had written for the other. The instruction manual included what makes us happy, annoys us, and other idiosyncrasies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, one of the "awkward question" discussions regarded my interest in exploring other women. I was honest and said that yes, I was interested in sex with other people (C2 was my first but I didn't want her to be the only person).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C2 was angry and frustrated. We were both happy, and she would have been satisfied with an exclusive long term relationship. I was her ideal partner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
Getting to the discussion about kids was important as it is a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unbeknownst to C2, while I was thinking about sex with other people I had two candidate girls in mind. Everything I told C2 was true; I didn't go into detail about the source of the motivation. Ironically, both candidates found boyfriends soon after I broke up with C2.</content>

    <title>deciding between two choices indicates incomplete analysis</title>
    <content type='html'>There are two general categories of causes for mistakes: mistakes by commission, and mistakes by omission. Mistakes by commission are when a decision maker makes a choice, but it turns out to be wrong. Mistakes by omission are when a decision maker fails by not making a decision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Errors by commission are due to not enough information about the choices, incomplete set of choices presented, misinterpreting the available information regarding the choices. A decision maker cannot possibly gather all the information, nor present all options, and is fallible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically I see the need for a decision, come up with two options, then decide between the two options. This causes mistakes by commission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can think of the following motivations for coming up with only two choices (rather than more). Two is the lowest number of choices I can come up &amp;nbsp;with before making a decision. That means it's both the least amount of work (thinking, research), and takes the least amount of time. Comparing two choices is easier than comparing three or more choices. With two choices, it's easy to categorize one of the options as "bad" and the other "good."</content>

    <title>M2: the supermodel I won't be dating</title>
    <content type='html'>Found M2 on match.com. No face shown in profile picture, but nice body and good profile content. Attending graduate school in the same city I live in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First date:&lt;br /&gt;
As I expected, she is extremely sexy -- a Chilean supermodel. She's my age, but this is her first year of grad school, as she worked between college and now. She's done lots of travel, both for work and pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the fifth person I've ever dated, and she has all the traits I want: amazing beauty, brilliant, and interesting depth of experience. We have similar interests and talked for more than two hours; it felt like minutes to me because I was enjoying the experience so much.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>unconditional love</title>
    <content type='html'>I realized that I seek emotional bonding conditionally. My interest is based on physical attraction or understanding how the person thinks. Conditional love is not my goal. But how to experience unconditional love?&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>emotional bonds resulting from taking risks</title>
    <content type='html'>Emotional bond is spurred by risk. Specifically, risk of loss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't feel risk of loss because I feel I could find a better partner than the person I'm with.&lt;br /&gt;
The evidence that better girls are available is the existence of girls I socialize with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This helps explain why girls attracted to me do feel emotionally bonded. For them there is a risk of loss because they might not do better than me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This also explains my apparent lack of jealousy. Why would I feel jealous if there's no risk of my girlfriend finding a better partner?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the "risk of loss" hypothesis of emotional bonding, what options are available?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accept the hypothesis and date an attractive, brilliant, emotionally available woman&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change the need for loss. What else is risk with respect to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change the need for risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a way to bond with unattractive or dumb people. Why should emotional bond depend on appearance or intelligence?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Establish emotional vulnerability by taking risk. Risk getting hurt emotionally, or get reward of emotional satisfaction</content>

    <title>ready for marriage? Here's a checklist to figure out the answer</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;What makes a good mate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared sense of humor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical comfort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared moral values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level of critical thinking (aka education)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
money isn't a direct factor, but it does influence behavior and attitude&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Similar socio-economic background is good, as it leads to shared values and attitudes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Motivations for getting married&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial security&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional security&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability of sex and pleasure&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You think your partner is unique and desirable&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I had broken up with my girlfriend, C2, a month before. I decided to reward K1 with my number for her social aggressiveness even though I found her unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First date:&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to let her know I would be available to meet with after my workout ended at 8:30pm. We met at a restaurant I suggested and split a sandwich I bought. She was as unattractive as I recalled. She talked incessantly for two hours while I smiled and nodded. I merely had to act engaged and she regaled me with the drama of her family, then her job in gritty detail. The restaurant eventually closed and we stood in front of the door making out in the freezing cold. We eventually parted around 12:50am&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Second date:&lt;br /&gt;
I invited her over to my house for a massage. When she arrived I was making a pizza dough. We talked. &amp;nbsp;I served drinks - water, &amp;nbsp;juice, &amp;nbsp;milk. We moved in my living room which has no couch so we lay on floor. This quickly evolved to making out, then progressed to a tour of the upstairs bedrooms. A massage in spare bedroom, &amp;nbsp;then sex in master bedroom. &amp;nbsp;I made her come twice. We went to sleep around midnight.&lt;br /&gt;
I woke to my alarm at 6am Saturday. We showered together. &amp;nbsp;She gave me a blow job in bed, I came in her mouth and she swallowed. &amp;nbsp;Breakfast of toasted English muffins. She left on time -- 7am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Third date:&lt;br /&gt;
I invited her to my house after I had been at the gym. She arrived 8:30pm and I made a small salad. She talked, then made out. It was late and I was tired. She couldn't have sex, but wanted to give a blowjob. I accepted but didn't come. She left around 11:30pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fourth date:&lt;br /&gt;
We met at my house and she drove me to lunch at a nearby resturant. We went to a roller derby event (her main social hobby). She drove me back to my house and we ate supper together (I cooked). Talked until 11pm, then she went home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
Not my type: long hair, fat, tall, not smart, &amp;nbsp;drama with family, too much tongue play during kissing, bad breath, dry skin. Lack of interesting life experience as far as travel, &amp;nbsp;hobbies, social life. Poor social decisions growing up. I don't find makeup or jewelry attractive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Limited education and poor, which to me indicates she didn't put much thought into her actions growing up. This alone isn't terrible now, but it forms her current personality. Also may have resulted in her history of abusive relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
K1 isn't goal oriented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Limited topics of conversation (family history/drama, work drama). Consistently complaining about family and work drama with no clear action intended. Talking 90% of the time and not actually interacting in conversation, even after I pointed this out explicitly.&lt;br /&gt;
I think people talk about themselves because it's a safe topic (little fear of upsetting the other person) and they are knowledgeable regarding their own experience.&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast, I don't talk much about myself, although if the other person asks questions I'm willing to answer. Instead, I have a sense of curiosity to ask questions about the other person's story, and the ability to listen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the positive side, &amp;nbsp;comfortable naked and gave good blow job.&lt;br /&gt;
My first screamer during orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
K1 initially said during our forth date that she didn't want to share me, which sounds like exclusivity (something I dislike). However, this is her reaction to previous relationships where she was cheated on.&lt;br /&gt;
She later said during date four that she would be ok with me seeing other people as long as I kept her informed. She doesn't want to be compared with my other girl friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This experiment demonstrated that I can have an erection and come with a girl I find unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;
From this experience I learned that an attractive personality is as important as physical attractiveness. I expect that as I continue to date, compatibility of personality will be harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I learned that education can be a filter for careers: low-skilled labor gets all the high-school drama.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I find insecurity unattractive in the girls I'm dating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I want to be proud "showing off" the girl I'm dating to my friends. While I'm not explicitly after the approval of my friends, they reflect my values and interests. I never overlapped K1 with my friends.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Age isn't as important as maturity. K1 was younger than C2, but I enjoy the fuller life experience and independence of C2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I desire the following traits in a girl: good looks, intelligence, and depth of experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>about me</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm a research scientist working at a university. I have a PhD in physics. I enjoy my work and my coworkers. I'm a single white male seeking attractive female to have fun with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have tendencies towards Asperger's, but I'm able to seem normal most of the time. I run my social life through meetup.com. The action resulting from my self-diagnosis of Asperger's is that I require much more alone time than most people. I attempt to balance social activities and alone time, but am more self-focused than many people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the age of 27 I decided social skills would be useful. I started learning about conversation. I read self help books. I watched PUA videos. Until ~2013, I had few friends and no intimate relationships. Now that I have time and money, I work on having a social life and meaningful interaction. I've learned I optimize for happiness, both my own and that of the people I surround myself with.</content>

    <title>emotional reasoning (as contrasted with standard logical reasoning)</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;
I typically regard myself as a reasonably logical thinker. Then I learned that in order to make the correct decision it would require gathering all the information. Since this isn't practical, humans use emotions to determine when the information gathering should terminate and a decision rendered (see the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"&gt;halting problem&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, even people who claim to make purely logical decisions use emotions to make decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The amount of standard logic used to make decisions from person to person. For the purposes of this post, I'll simplify to two extremes -- logical thinking and emotional thinking. People who apply less standard logic use more emotional reasoning. If emotional reasoning doesn't use logic, then what is the mechanism or process?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Logical versus emotion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Typically logic is applied as a universal condition. For any situation A, take action B. There is the possibility for contingency, and it would be of the form, "For any situation A, take action B unless K occurred before A, then take action C." In contrast, &lt;b&gt;emotional reasoning can be situationally dependent&lt;/b&gt;. "In situation A today I'm going to take action D, but if A had occurred last week I would have done F."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Certain situations evoke biological responses, ie being surprised by a sudden change in the local environment. A logical response when this surprise occurs again is, "Last time when X happened, it was followed by Y, so this time I'll.." In contrast, an emotional response goes like, Last time when X happened, I felt Z, so this time I feel..." &lt;b&gt;Emotional reasoning relates the current situation to previous situations which induced emotional responses.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Conclusions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The reason this alternative method of thinking matters is because many people use it. For example, when a parent runs out of logical arguments with their children, they have to resort to emotional reasoning.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>dissatisfied with monogomy</title>
    <content type='html'>I want to have sex with every attractive girl that I see. I recognize that that is an unrealistic objective. &lt;br /&gt;
I want physical intimacy and emotional intimacy and vulnerability in my interactions.


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Touch (hugs) does not satiate my appetite for physical intimacy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I accept that I am in a monogamous relationship. &lt;br /&gt;
I am attracted to and grateful to my girlfriend.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My state and my goals are in conflict; these manifests as unhappiness.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>have I over-engineered my life to exclude having sex with other girls?</title>
    <content type='html'>I've engineered my life to have controlled risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know what I dislike: bad decisions, poorly designed processes, and rhetorical questions.&lt;br /&gt;
I also know what I value: autonomy, learning how to improve how I think (ie meditation, programming), and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoy pleasure. The sources of pleasure for me include sex and attention-time of hot girls which may lead to sex. Physical exercise, ie yoga, weight lifting, also seems to fit this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Autonomy can require resources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm willing to sacrifice autonomy for limited duration to enable social activities&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I socialize because I expect it is psychologically healthy and for the unexpected results</content>

    <title>How to flirt</title>
    <content type='html'>What: I took a class called "How to Flirt." The audience was a balanced mix of gay/straight, male/female, white/black/asian, single/married&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Status: prior to this class, I didn't know what flirting was (now I have some idea). I didn't (and still don't) know when someone is flirting with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Preview of content: flirting is essentially social skills + intent (and not goals).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two general points&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social calibration matters -- &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness"&gt;situational awareness&lt;/a&gt; applied to relationships, emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honesty about who you are, aka authenticity, matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You should be confident in social interactions. How to be confident:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appearance is relevant, both in how people judge you and how you feel about yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be direct but playful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move on from mistakes. &amp;nbsp;Find humor in your mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posture is important for both how others see you and how you feel about yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise. This will help you know your limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;masturbate. This will help you know your preferences&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speak slower. This is interpreted as confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be interesting -- you need to be able to explain to other people why you are interesting. What is your personal narrative?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fake it until you make it (i.e., upon first interaction). Once you're past the initial interaction, switch to being authentic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every interaction has a goal. For example, you goal may be&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kiss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;companionship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Problem with having a goal: expectations might be unmet.&lt;br /&gt;
Solution: Remove the big goals and focus on smaller, more realistic outcomes&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; Broaden your definition of intimacy and success&lt;br /&gt;
For example, small steps (micro goals) include&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eye contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give an authentic&amp;nbsp;compliment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invite the person to an activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
There are two types of complements: "drive-by" and "conversation opener."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A conversation-opener complement prompts a response, whereas a drive-by does not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Example of drive-by complement: "Nice beard."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Example of conversation opener: "Nice beard. How long have you grown it?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are three approach styles (bashful, budding, bold), distinguished by level of social aggressiveness. No style is better than the other two. Which fits you depends on your personality -- be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approach style: "bashful"&lt;br /&gt;
For this style, ways of causing interaction include&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give a drive-by complement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask for help, ask for resources, ask for their preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be helpful -- offer assistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eye contact. If this doesn't come naturally, use "triangle gaze": look at the middle of their forehead, then switch to the edges of their mouth on both sides. Keep your gaze rotating among these three points on their face (rather than an intent stare of locking eyes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to focus on interaction, &amp;nbsp;not outcome&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=protip"&gt;pro-tip&lt;/a&gt;: "flirting face." Use the body language, spatial distance, and facial motions of the reaction you have when you wonder, "Do I recognize that person?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approach style: "budding"&lt;br /&gt;
For this style, ways of causing interaction include&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compliment which require response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy small token gift (i.e., coffee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice reciprocal disclosure (answer, followed by question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approach style: "Bold"&lt;br /&gt;
For this style, ways of causing interaction include&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;directly admit attraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to avoid being creepy, run your ideas for interaction past third parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead with awkward. Identify why you feel awkward, then talk about that with the target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rejection by the other person is them rejecting the moment, not of you (remember, they don't know you)&lt;br /&gt;
To avoid dwelling on rejection, stay busy in your life&lt;br /&gt;
Don't overly focus on one target (even if you're married). You need strong social network&lt;br /&gt;
Set aside time for platonic relationships&lt;br /&gt;
Don't date to fill a void.&lt;br /&gt;
Go on a date by yourself&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_script"&gt;Social scripts&lt;/a&gt; for interaction displaces authentic intent.&lt;br /&gt;
Summary of &lt;a href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/01/rescripting-sex.html"&gt;Pervocracy blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
There are scripts for sex, such as&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consent roulette script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot lawyers script for consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small steps, with enthusiastic response. &amp;nbsp;Reciprocal response (answer, question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After class was over, I still didn't know what flirting was, so I asked the instructor. She said to recall that I should set an intention, not have a goal. That's what flirting is about.&lt;br /&gt;
Have a direction, not destination.</content>

    <title>hosting a great meetup event</title>
    <content type='html'>Where to have an event:&lt;br /&gt;
Meeting in public spaces yields better turnout -- participants are taking less risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What to include in the event description&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify where are you all are meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify how long the event is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biographical background on the host. Specify that you are hosting the event, and provide credentials as to your qualifications as a host (relevant to that event)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the event is an activity, are you meeting for drinks or dinner after?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should participants bring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much will participants spend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If carpooling, participants should split the gas cost with their driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a waiver is required, make the waiver available in the event description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Timing:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan an event and post the description 2 or 3 weeks in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants will show up about 15 minutes late&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What to expect for RSVPs:&lt;br /&gt;
There's a threshold for sign up. No one signs up until everyone signs up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actual attendance:&lt;br /&gt;
The better you know potential participants, the more likely they are to show up&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type='html'>After more than 2 years in a relationship, L1 broke up with me on Friday, December 2, 2016. After breaking up we then went to a party in the evening, and another on Saturday afternoon. This was what I was seeking in a breakup -- that we remain friends and actually do stuff together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We still have a strong component of lust. We are both horny and physically attracted to each other. We enjoy each other's company for short durations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
L1 has strong emotional feelings and I am not reciprocating. I'd like to, but I don't feel any emotional bond. The cause of this is probably that I don't respect or value L1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason I respect people is because they are good communicators, passionate about something, doing something unusual with their lives, and are brilliant. L1 has none of these aspects.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason I value someone is because they have experience or knowledge that I could benefit from. L1 does not.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason I think someone is a badass is because they have unusual life experiences that have shaped their perspective. L1 has not had this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't think it's reasonable for L1 to try and qualify for any one of these definitions. Thus choices include (me changing my definitions) and (me finding someone else who does qualify).</content>

    <title>emotion and touch</title>
    <content type='html'>I form emotional bonds based on physical touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want touch and emotional bond with people I find attractive.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't seek touch or emotional bond with people I do not find attractive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emotional bond implies I am, in a limited sense, beholden to that person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to feel the sense of being beholden is worth investment, I want to be getting something of value. Here value is the possibility of interaction with people I find attractive.</content>

    <title>lessons learned from interacting with my girlfriend</title>
    <content type='html'>Auto correct to the wrong spelling for a name is bad. Solution: remove incorrect spelling from autocomplete dictionary&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Voice dictation of a name can yield the wrong spelling of a name&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unnecessarily complex sentence structure can result in unintended interpretations. Solution: use simple sentence structure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made an assumption about my girlfriend, then stated it as fact to her. The assumption was incorrect, and she felt bad that I had misunderstood. Solution: identify my assumption, then form it as a question to her.</content>

    <title>Aspects of emotional development I need to work on</title>
    <content type='html'>"Love all beings" is not consistent with my definition of respect&lt;br /&gt;
Respect = because the person is brilliant, communicates well, is passionate, and doing something unusual with their life&lt;br /&gt;
Love = a physiological sensation in my chest&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How should I handle love and my feelings of lust? Can love and lust be concurrent?&lt;br /&gt;
Lust has multiple sources:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private validation of my ego&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public validation of my ego&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;desire for physical pleasure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want emotion without attachment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patterns lead to expectations. Desire for decreased risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've been using YouTube videos to provide emotional stimulus. Music videos, short clips from TV and movies. These provide enough stimulation of the type I want and the duration I'm seeking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've been using Facebook to provide social stimulus; again when and how I want.</content>

    <title>I am willing to sacrifice for extremely hot girls</title>
    <content type='html'>I attended a fancy reception in an expensive hotel where the host had hired a group of very attractive models to serve as greeters. After the reception I felt frustrated. I don't typically encounter girls that hot in my social circles, and the evening presented proof that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dating apps (ie Tinder, Coffee Meets Bagel) and online dating (ie OKCupid) doesn't have many girls of this level of hotness. That's reasonable, as these girls would have no problem getting plenty of interest in real life.</content>

    <title>Craigslist m4w scammers</title>
    <content type='html'>I posted the following in "m4w" (men looking for women) on craigslist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;Hey all you humans. Don't reply to this post. I'm seeking scammer replies so I can train my filter. I'm seeking automated replies, people who don't read posts, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;If you find this humorous, feel free to chortle. If you want to collaborate or share tips, put the subject, "I may be a data scientist" in the subject line. If you are a female and want to talk with a guy who treats dating and casual encounters as a data processing challenge, reply with the subject, "I find intelligence attractive" in the subject line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first 9 hours, I got 64 replies. I received no replies with either of the two suggested subjects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

    <title>My motivation for dating has significantly changed</title>
    <content type='html'>From the time I started dating (about 31 years old) until a few weeks ago, I dated girls to have sex with them. I was drawn to girls with a specific physical body type. I sought someone who is compatible, but I had little insight as to what that meant in practice. Shared values mattered, but I didn't know what that was in practice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the past few weeks I've felt intense emotions different than any other attraction I've experienced. Butterflies in my stomach distinct from anxiety. A rush of longing when the person isn't present. A desire to spend all my time with this person (prioritizing them above all else).</content>

    <title>I am socializing less</title>
    <content type='html'>In the past year or two, I've observed that I socialize less than I used to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A major factor is that I have relationship with a partner. Because I spend time with my girlfriend, I have less motive to socialize with other people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fewer interactions I have with people, the less disappointed I am in both myself and others.</content>

    <title>concise lessons learned for getting girls</title>
    <content type='html'>Keep texts short&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Limit texts to 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Keep texts having levity&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Order of who knows what when matters&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Communication is good&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
How people communicate is different&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Be blind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Be deaf&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Conversation with just eyes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Appearance and smell have a threshold of mattering&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Stability and finances matter to a threshold&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Being slightly above the local average helps&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Intelligence helps, but it is not the first judgement&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Peacocking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Look for situations with good odds in good environments&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>pro-tips in dating</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
Dating apps&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguish yourself. Pictures of you in a suit is typical. You with a hunting accomplishment is likely a turn-off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if she has a picture of a pet-like animal, ask her about it. She likely has a strong positive emotional state associated with the animal, or at minimum a story to tell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interaction should lead to more interaction - say something, then ask a question that is open-ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"You're not physically attractive" is not a positive statement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to flirt&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whisper to her. This conveys that you are speaking only to her, and sharing the message is risky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make her grin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make her blush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Truth and communication</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;
A friend came to me for help, and I offered her the help she sought. Once the time came to specify the logistics of the help, there was disagreement about what had been agreed to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
When I say something to someone else, I try to be honest -- I mean what I say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What the she interpreted what I had said, she used her definition of the words heard. The truth became what the she understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Once disagreement based on perceived dishonesty occurs, recovery of trust is difficult.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>date within your own species</title>
    <content type='html'>The advice of "date within your own species" was given to me when I realized I wasn't monogamous. I recognized what was meant -- that dating monogamous people wasn't going to yield success -- but I also knew that I would need to learn that lesson myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've gone on first dates with monogamous girls. In an effort to be up front, I tell them that during our first in-person meeting.</content>
