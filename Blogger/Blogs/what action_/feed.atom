    <title>rhetorical tactics observed in use by politicians</title>
    <content type='html'>Here are some&amp;nbsp;rhetorical tactics I've seen used by&amp;nbsp;politicians&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ignore the question&lt;br /&gt;
Tell a personal story&lt;br /&gt;
Advance your own agenda (while ignoring the question)&lt;br /&gt;
Attack the asker&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>effective democracy takes work and is expensive</title>
    <content type='html'>Research is not cheap -- there are necessarily failures required to gain knowledge. Democracy is an experiment in governance. To build insight on creation of effective government&amp;nbsp;requires effort and investment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to "not investing", another option is to use signaling. Signaling is the indication of work without&amp;nbsp;doing work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signaling would be beat by real work if there was a long-term incentive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are examples of signaling in nature. Frogs that aren't poisonous and merely look like an actual poison frog. In this case, the faker relies on the entity which actually does work.&amp;nbsp; If no one does work, then signaling doesn't sustain in the long term.</content>

What's effective in shaping campaigning politicians?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What's effective in reaching current politicians?&lt;br /&gt;
1) in person meetings&lt;br /&gt;
2) phone calls&lt;br /&gt;
http://billmoyers.com/2012/12/26/do-politicians-read-the-emails-you-send-them/&lt;br /&gt;
"best way to make sure a politician gets your message is still to call up his or her office local office — or even better, go there in person — and tell a staffer why an issue is important to you."&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>generically applicable solutions; not specific to politics</title>
    <content type='html'>Suppose I want to resolve issues in the political arena. I could simply advocate for the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if everyone were more educated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if everyone were better at communication?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if everyone were better at introspecting?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The underlying assumption of these approach is that if everyone were more educated, better at communicating, and better at introspection, they'd arrive at the appropriate solution.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Time scales of change</title>
    <content type='html'>When figuring out how to take action, it's important to understand the relative timescales for the opportunities:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Protests - months&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cultural change (memetic: fashion, laws, what's normal) - years&lt;br /&gt;
Technology (communication) - years&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Political change - decade&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generational change - 30-40 years</content>

    <title>Root cause: Illusion of the American Dream</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream"&gt;American Dream&lt;/a&gt; is a vision of "opportunity for prosperity and success, and an upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suspect that this vision is the cause of some societal issues. When we see someone who is rich and prospering, our instinct is to think, "I too could achieve that result." Therefore, if the rich person makes claims, we listen and assign value to what they say because they are a role model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who are the cultural role models? "Rich and famous" people who consume many thought cycles of the general populace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This vision inspires financial greed, competition for resources, and selfishness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then how do I change the American Dream?&lt;br /&gt;
What should it be changed to?</content>

    <title>reasoning by analogy is limited</title>
    <content type='html'>Though I refer to politics as theater, the similarities are limited. There's no stage, no manager, no script. That means politics is more complex than artificial theater.</content>

    <title>balancing short-term thinking and long-term thinking</title>
    <content type='html'>There's an equilibrium between&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tragedy of the commons: immediate benefit to me (local) outweighs cost for others in the long-term. Incentives for the individual do not align with the well-being of the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approaches to governing a society that require immediate work and have long-term outcomes with diffuse benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Equilibrium means minimizing work needed from participants while ensuring the success of the group. "Success of the group" merely means continued existence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Factors relevant to determining the equilibrium:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size of society. For&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number"&gt;small groups&lt;/a&gt;, one-on-one communication is sufficient to build consensus. Past a certain threshold of group size, the ability to spend time communicating with every member drops below a temporal attention threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceived social norms associated with acceptable behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;literacy/education of members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to communicate with other members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bandwidth (email versus phone versus video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latency (paper letters versus email)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relative inequality of members in the group with respect to security, resources, ability to communicate, level of education,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the individual, how emotional (short-term) versus how analytical (long-term) is decision making&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Enumerating the factors allows us to identify options that push the equilibrium in one direction or another.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many hyperlinks in text&lt;/li&gt;

Feedback from reviewer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the top navigation bar is confusing. The different formats have the same content&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
Feedback from reviewer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need more color. Currently isn't professional looking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid casting the change as "progress" or "improvement" or "better"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use more pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use smaller words ("quantitatively" is too big). Needs to target 8th grade education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't use "I"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what's the desired action/outcome for readers?&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type='html'>economics (capitalism), principles (suffering), human nature (greed), and Maslow's hierarchy of needs may not be aligned&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>What is the most effective approach to running a society?</title>
    <content type='html'>The experiment is underway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A state is defined by two aspects: physical boundaries and sanctioned violence. Practically, ability to enforce policy enables society.&amp;nbsp; Within this paradigm, various approaches have&amp;nbsp; arisen. No rules exist other than physics; everything else is convention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Existence of multiple states is probably an artifact of limited bandwidth and high latency over physical distance, as well as compute and data storage limits. With increased bandwidth, decreased latency, increased compute, and increased storage the physical scale of what a state can reasonably be is increased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
suggestions: number of layers in hierarchy, terrain, insufficient resources locally, sufficient energy to interact&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there value in partitioning physical space and having different policies enforced in distinct states? Lower efficiency, but evolution benefits from heterogeneity.</content>

    <title>notes from a meeting of conservatives</title>
    <content type='html'>People seek a way to understand their experience - same motivation as science, religion&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Basis of reasoning - constitution, religion, science, free market&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these bases are sparked by some experience.&lt;br /&gt;
These are sort of principles, but they are external collections of concepts.&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these are interpreted subjectively&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Intelligence + story telling incurs respect.&lt;br /&gt;
People in the audience respond with the topic they have emotional interest in or experience with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emotional satisfaction of winning debate, curiosity, love of learning&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Priority is being able to articulate principles&lt;br /&gt;
There's an expectation that behavior and decisions are rational. Yet there's recognition that politics is emotional.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone holds themselves as rationalists.&lt;br /&gt;
Reasoning from generalizations and platitudes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans are emotional beings with a capacity to think&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Concepts like liberty, freedom, rights are all ill defined&lt;br /&gt;
Then there are a bunch of abstractions like cities, land boundaries, states, associations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another approach is to identify intended outcomes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Language: win, lose, opponents, fight</content>

    <title>politics is more like religion than science</title>
    <content type='html'>In science we try to make falsifiable claims so that we can find evidence that our current view needs correction. The assumption is that we are seeking an explanation of reality. The mindset in science is based on curiosity: "I think this is how the world operates, so I'm going to take action that clarifies the validity of my assumptions."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In religion we assume our current perspective is the truth and then attempt to explain away all the inconsistencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Politics is not about seeking truth. Instead it seems to be about starting with a perspective and then fighting to implement that ideology. The mindset in politics is "I think this is how the world operates, so I'm going to take action that reinforces those assumptions."</content>

    <title>opinions are the norm; data collection and analysis is not</title>
    <content type='html'>Everyone has an opinion. Typically emotionally based. Some people have principles and logically derive their opinion augmented by their experience and&amp;nbsp;anecdotes. The "facts" are selected statistics that are probably out of context.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The process of {recognizing the need for data, getting data, analyzing data} is totally foreign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"What I know is what I've heard or seen." That mentality is sufficient for getting through normal life. The fact that politics is more complicated doesn't cause anyone to think that a different paradigm is needed.</content>

    <title>Disrupting OODA in the model phase</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop"&gt;OODA loop&lt;/a&gt; is the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act. The "observe" phase is information gathering; "orient" means evaluation in comparison with an internal model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are many way of getting better results in a competitive environment:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get information faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;process the information faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get more (relevant) information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The complication is that the model against which information is compared is not static and is impacted by incoming information. In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games#Infinite_vs._finite_games"&gt;the infinite game&lt;/a&gt; with low barriers to both creation of information and dissemination of information, altering your competitor's model is a powerful method of shaping outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
To alter someone's model used in the OODA process, it is helpful to understand how models are built by the individual. Much information is provided to the individual ("observe"), and then rewards and punishments are applied based on actions ("act"). The "orient" and "decide" aspects are internal to the person. This process of feedback is found in formal education -- classes, homework, tests, and grades. Once a person leaves formal education, the feedback of rewards and punishments is more diffuse and have longer time spans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
To alter a person's model in the OODA loop, it's also helpful to prescribe a few more aspects to what constitutes a model. A model is a set of connected assumptions intended to replicate and predict reality. Each individual typically assumes there model is "knowledge" consistent with reality.&amp;nbsp; A subset of assumptions in the model are considered "conventions," implying that other individuals share the same assumptions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
By recognizing which assumptions are conventions, we can think about why the convention exists and what the consequences could be if the convention is not adhered to. Then we can act differently from convention to generate novel information consumed by other people. These abnormal inputs then alter the other person's model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Not adhering to convention doesn't imply a conscious decision by the individual. Deviation from the expected norm may be based on a person's personality or experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Motivation for starting this blog</title>
    <content type='html'>Claim: the United States of America is in a state of decline economically and culturally. Although this could be applied at any point in history, here are my motivations as to why this is valid now:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indefinite detention of citizens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlargement&amp;nbsp;of the military-industrial&amp;nbsp;complex: more money, more power. See also creation of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security"&gt;DHS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration"&gt;TSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiving constitutional rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endorsement of torture of human beings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intentionally breaking technology we created&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased education of populace&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>lessons learned by observing conservatives</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Observation&lt;/i&gt;: tactics don't need to be derived from strategy; tactics merely needs to support the strategy. --&amp;gt; Ends justify the means.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Observation&lt;/i&gt;: truisms and platitudes are useful for filling time and leaving the audience saying, "yes, that's right."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Observation&lt;/i&gt;: Use of ill-defined emotional words are great for talking with supporters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"politicians are corrupt"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"drain the swamp"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X is "destroying this country from the inside out"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"money is the mother's milk of politics" [attributed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_M._Unruh"&gt;Jesse Unruh&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Each of these observations are surprising to me because they run counter to my understanding of how to make progress.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>don't get caught up in the production</title>
    <content type='html'>Liberals are as captivated by Donald Trump as Trump's base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What's needed:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ability to frame inconsistency (rather than responding to it)&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>stories and emotion</title>
    <content type='html'>What if a given label is interpreted subjectively by participants? Each person's environment is shared and viewed distinctly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; Be wary of stories that feel good and rationalize observations and are not based on evidence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stories --&amp;gt; emotion --&amp;gt; decisions --&amp;gt; action&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"issues" are stories. A story is a sequence of logic applied to facts. What data gets transformed and what logic is applied depends on "values."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What stories unify and are emotionally resonant?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's no demand for data since a majority of stakeholders aren't going to analyze data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Concepts that are not measurable and either feel good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"rule of law"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"hold elected officials accountable"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"group X is composed of sheep"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"get involved""conservative/liberal values"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"it's not fair"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"the other side"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Words matter -- "opponent" casts people not in your group in a negative emotional sense.&lt;br /&gt;
Labels unite and divide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are not opposed we should be cooperating. It's not candidate versus candidate within the party, and it's not party against party, and it's not country against country. We are all humans living on earth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used to be all about the data and the data analysis. That's necessary but not sufficient to be correct. Emotional interpretation of the story is at least as important to how people act. Just having an emotional reaction can lead people to the wrong outcome. The best case is one in which data and analysis leads to a conclusion and is supported with an emotional story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>"bipartisan issues" have detractors</title>
    <content type='html'>The implication of the phrase&amp;nbsp;"bipartisan issues" is that two political parties support a specific idea. The idea still has detractors. I'm not aware of any idea that has no detractors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take the idea of government transparency. In order to know what government is doing, data is needed. Detractors argue that data collection costs money and time and therefore introduces inefficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone wants lower bills, right? Nope.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>alternatives</title>
    <content type='html'>Suppose the electoral college were eliminated, significant improvements in campaign financing were made, and corporations were no longer considered persons. We might have a more functional democracy, but that may not be optimal. What are alternatives? (Once the alternatives are enumerated, evaluate which features could be applied in the current situation.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Winner-take-all election outcomes drive binary political parties with an even split. Alternative: European democracies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"One person, one vote" is strange to me -- each person is not equally knowledgeable in all domains that they are effectively voting on. Also, citizens are susceptible to emotional influence. As an alternative, amount of say on a matter should depend on amount of expertise and work contributed.</content>

    <title>a focus on changing laws is insufficient for long-term improvement</title>
    <content type='html'>If reform is sought, what method is optimal with respect to investing time and money?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One approach to reform is to attempt to change laws governing society. For example, I think the following laws/policies would enable a fairer society:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-partisian districts rather than gerrymandering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;campaign finance reform to enable increased transparency of funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better participation in voting process: everyone gets the day off, automatic registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electoral college reform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate barriers that limit current government to two parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Regardless of which laws you think would be beneficial, it's likely that a political party representing an opposing view could come into power and reverse the law.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A distinct approach (compared to changing policy and law) is to change perceived social norms.</content>

    <content type='html'>When I first started thinking about politics, I thought logic was the path to solutions. Then I realized &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/04/opinions-are-norm-data-collection-and.html"&gt;emotion plays a role&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see also &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/04/emotionally-resonant-stories.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/05/politics-should-be-logical-and-fact.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;). Then I arrived at the observation that &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/07/facts-versus-emotion-in-politics-whats.html"&gt;emotion is the core&lt;/a&gt;, not logic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I understand that we human seek emotional stimulation. It's not clear to me what the point of logic is.</content>

    <title>evaluating a system in the presence of other systems</title>
    <content type='html'>Asking "is capitalism a good system?" or "is democracy a good system?" limits the analysis to an artificial hypothetical in which each system is evaluated independently from others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In reality, every system of governance and economics is interplaying with others. The scope of control for a government may be limited, but individuals and information transcend the power boundaries.</content>

    <title>foundations and principles before topics</title>
    <content type='html'>My priorities for establishing a healthy society are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enable citizens to have the ability to meaningfully participate in the decision making process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out which decisions need to be made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In the first step, ensuring citizens can opt in to participate simply means participation is not required. There are a multitude of thornier questions:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who are the stakeholders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what's the timeline for input?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what's the granularity on issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what channels exist for communication?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>non-experts talking about complex topics</title>
    <content type='html'>I don't hear laypeople take about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics"&gt;quantum chromodynamics&lt;/a&gt;. Nor do simpler topics like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt; come up in conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do hear laypeople talk about international relations, economic policy, and healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I claim that all five of these topics have roughly the same day-to-day impact on individual laypeople. These laypeople have as much knowledge in each of the five topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then why do people talk about international relations and not thermodynamics?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps because there is financial incentive for the conversation on the subjective topics to go one direction or another?&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>decline implies peak</title>
    <content type='html'>If there is a decline ongoing, there must be a corresponding peak. This was an economic result of winning two world wars, both coming after a slavery-based economy with&amp;nbsp;imperialistic&amp;nbsp;desires. The United States also claimed moral superiority in the form of democracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The United States has effectively lost every military action since 1960 in that we did not have a clear well-defined victory -- Viet Nam, Korea, Iraq1, Iraq2,&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition we initiate un-winnable&amp;nbsp;domestic "wars" on drugs, while not addressing solvable problems -- education, income inequality.</content>

    <title>two fronts: emotions (short term) and rules (long term)</title>
    <content type='html'>I perceive two fronts in the political battle:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotional manipulation, typically fear-based. This is a short-term strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;altering the governance rules. This is a long-term strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I've been focused on &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2019/07/what-actions-would-be-relevant.html"&gt;countering the governance rules&lt;/a&gt; that I view as harmful to representative democracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
My effort at &lt;a href="https://scientificdemocracy.blogspot.com/2018/06/scientific-democracy.html"&gt;Scientific Democracy&lt;/a&gt; neglected the emotional aspect of human participation in politics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A naive counter to fear is hope. That is invariably unsustainable in the face of repeated stupidity and mistakes and wrong-doing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Another approach to responding to fear is to be righteous. Righteousness does not facilitate interaction with people who are fearful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>current mindset - a sequence of questions</title>
    <content type='html'>In the current political situation, I face a set of ordered questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Stay or go?&lt;/h3&gt;
Should I stay or should I go to somewhere else? Depends on whether I think I can be more effective here or somewhere else. [Be more effective at what?]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Go: where?&lt;/h3&gt;
If I decide to go, where should I go?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Stay: respond how?&lt;/h3&gt;
What we had was inverted totalitarianism. What we appear to be moving toward is guided democracy, with the method being inconsistent lies. I don't want to change back to what was; I want something better -- &lt;a href="http://www.scientificdemocracy.org/"&gt;scientific democracy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scientific democracy assumes society wants to make progress, but doesn't specify towards what specific outcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
How do I deal with the current tactics of inconsistent lies?&lt;/h3&gt;
We have the same options in politics that are available in dealing with religion: engage, repress, or contain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Simple emotional arguments dominate politics</title>
    <content type='html'>Complicated solutions, even though correct, are more challenging to convince the voting public.&lt;br /&gt;

Democratic approach limits complexity when communicating with voters. Simpler concise emotional arguments are dominant.</content>

    <title>Observations from attending meetings of local conservative and liberal organizations</title>
    <content type='html'>I've been attending meetings of conservatives and liberals. My goal is to internalize all perspectives of stakeholders. &amp;nbsp;I want to listen, not debate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Imprecise language&lt;/h3&gt;
Most participants of both liberal and conservative groups use imprecise language. Examples include inaccurate generalizations, lack of information, exaggeration, and emotionally-driven statements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Motivations are misrepresented&lt;/h3&gt;
One group will assign motivation to participants of other groups&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Lack of shared facts&lt;/h3&gt;
The same event is viewed differently -- basic facts are not agreed upon. Outcomes are interpreted differently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Emotional analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
Anger, frustration, anxiety, fear are common in stressful situations. This is not specific to politics. It's personal and passionate and identity&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Typical coping mechanisms: avoidance, dismissive, turn off, impersonalize by using facts. What are your mechanisms?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Compassion, curiosity&lt;br /&gt;
Observe the other person's intention or objective. Is the other person curious or looking to argue?&lt;br /&gt;
What is my intention for this interaction?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you causing other people to feel anxiety?</content>

    <title>who does government actually benefit?</title>
    <content type='html'>A private business benefits the owner of the business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A publicly traded company benefits shareholders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"&gt;coop&lt;/a&gt; benefits members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A government is supposed to benefit citizens.&lt;br /&gt;
Who does the government actually benefit now? Politicians, corporations?</content>

    <title>How to define decline of the United States</title>
    <content type='html'>What does a decline mean? There are many cultural and economic metrics, such as GDP, happiness index, etc. However, my way of determining is by asking "which country do a majority of non-citizens envy?" If the popular answer changes from one country to another, then the former top country has experienced a decline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are three possible ways forward in a given field: decline, stagnation, or improvement. Therefore, if we are stagnant and others are improving, does attention shift to where improvement is&amp;nbsp;occurring?</content>

    <title>technology platforms useful for activism</title>
    <content type='html'>all services are free unless otherwise noted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Meetup&lt;/b&gt;: free to join and participate; organizing a new meetup group costs money. Useful for posting and sharing events. &amp;nbsp;Groups are public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Facebook&lt;/b&gt;: private and public groups. Private and public events&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Email&lt;/b&gt;: can be encrypted, though typically isn't.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Google Groups&lt;/b&gt;: public and private boards. Better than email for adding new users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Trello&lt;/b&gt;: task tracker; requires login (boards are not public)</content>

    <title>notes from local protest rally vigil</title>
    <content type='html'>"Replace the people in positions of power" is a very tangible reaction to seeing problems in a system.&lt;br /&gt;
Changing the incentive structure for anyone in a decision making capacity doesn't have the same feel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Optics matter. Optics require tokens. Tokens require planning and money

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participants don't understand systems. &lt;br /&gt;
Lack insight on how to cause change&lt;br /&gt;
Measure progress is difficult&lt;br /&gt;
People need an explanation for events&lt;br /&gt;
Conspiracy theories displace knowledge

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lots of local activists present

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emotional intensity without expertise&lt;br /&gt;
Frustration causes communication capability to decrease&lt;br /&gt;
Processes are complex, participants have conflicting interests

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One politician present (senator)&lt;br /&gt;
A person running for council passing by&lt;br /&gt;
ACLU rep&lt;br /&gt;
Real news Network

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't know the street jargon&lt;br /&gt;
Mic check - call and response&lt;br /&gt;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microphone

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Goal: accountability&lt;br /&gt;
Reaffirmed belief in God&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Police intimidation, gag orders

&lt;br /&gt;
Shared local history as reference experience&lt;br /&gt;
Local CVS more important than our lives?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Persistence and tenacity are easily recognized and valued&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Interactions are very personal. People know the names of the people who inflicted suffering

&lt;br /&gt;
Goal: throw out existing politicians, replace them


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Poli-trick-ians&lt;br /&gt;
Tel-lie-vision&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>prediction of war, local suffering, global suffering</title>
    <content type='html'>Three questions currently in my head:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What action can I take regarding war?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What action can I take to decrease suffering of those around me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What action can I take to decrease suffering of all people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I previously &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/02/prediction-new-war-within-two-years-by.html"&gt;predicted war within the next two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Objectives are for action to yield prevention, delay the onset, minimize the impact.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What levers are available?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
For the suffering questions (both local and global), there are a multitude of causes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
How does the suffering manifest in individuals? This is what the results of an action should impact&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase of anxiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change of choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Desired outcome: decrease of suffering; individuals are empowered to improve their life&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What actions are available?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;message current politicians: tweet, facebook, phone call, email,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vote for candidates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run for elected office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide services (legal, emotional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raise money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>the evolution of my perspective on politics</title>
    <content type='html'>Not that I spent a lot of thought on the topic, but my thinking was that politicians told the truth and occasionally lied. Not lying too much, as that would discredit them and result in a bad reputation. Also, a lie would be persistent, as they were presenting an alternative story. Eventually the lie would be revealed since it wasn't consistent with reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new method is to present so many lies about trivial and significant issues that fact checking is rendered useless. An assumption of fact checking is that there is a sense of accountability for the statements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lies are not intended to construct an alternative story. Instead, the purpose is temporary emotional satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have no insight on how to make progress in this environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope is the idea that there is a better state, and also that state can be reached. &amp;nbsp;While I think there exists a better state, I don't see a route to a better state.</content>

    <title>my ideal state of politics</title>
    <content type='html'>I think a better political environment is possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I've been fixated on logic and emotions for a while.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Perhaps there are other perspectives like the question, "Does this benefit everyone?"&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>__ as a right leads to irreconcilable differences</title>
    <content type='html'>Claiming something (a service, an ability, access to a location) as a right means you are not willing to negotiate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's no biological or physical basis for rights. Instead, a "right" is an assumption that everyone agrees on a specific idea. While that right may seem comforting, it's often ill-defined and not as common as desired.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Negotiating from the basis of "here are my assumptions and motivations" is a clearer way to proceed towards establishing consensus.</content>

    <title>inequality</title>
    <content type='html'>Equality statements:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person, one vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All men are created equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In practice, these are not occurring in our society&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person, one vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gerrymandering renders some votes ineffective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All men are created equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;genetics do not render humans equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;justice is not equal based on race or economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Options include&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;striving to make our society more equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing what the stated goals are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
More realistic:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a statistical threshold for well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define what a "right" is.&amp;nbsp;A right has no biological basis. It is a human construct. It is a consensus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>what are my principles?</title>
    <content type='html'>I've not been able to come up with principles yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Candidate&lt;/i&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule"&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;. "treat others as one would wish to be treated oneself."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Issue&lt;/i&gt;: this principle imposes your expectations on other people who may have different expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I like donuts. I like when other people give me donuts. So I bring donuts for my coworkers. One of my coworkers is on a diet and doesn't like the temptation of a free donut.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Candidate&lt;/i&gt;: decrease the suffering of all (human) beings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Issue&lt;/i&gt;: sometimes human intentionally seek suffering. Struggle is a part of growth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I like to go hiking. Hiking can be strenuous and causes minor suffering (ie sore legs). Thus I am intentionally increasing the amount of suffering in the Universe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I chose to go to college. I struggled in college. Therefore I intentionally increased my suffering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I let my daughter learn to tie her shoes on her own. She struggled, so I caused an increase in suffering of another human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Candidate&lt;/i&gt;: Enable the freedom to choose whether humans suffer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Issue&lt;/i&gt;: If you take risks and end up failing (and therefore suffering), you shouldn't then have the freedom to choose not to suffer the consequences of the risks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I intentionally am reckless with my driving my car and end up in a crash.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;: I decide to have a kid, which ends up being more responsibility than I want.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a difference between a conscious choice to suffer (ie hiking) and needless undesired suffering.</content>

    <title>Notes from "Our Revolution" by Bernie Sanders</title>
    <content type='html'>Vision: "an america for all people." This isn't a nationalist sentiment; merely the scope of the position he was seeking (president of the U.S.).&lt;br /&gt;
It's a moral position, from which he derives moral positions on other topics (see "Outline" section below). For each sub-topic, he has a set of specific actions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some people interpret the vision phrase as socialist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie's foreign policy position is non-interventionist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Outline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Oligarchy: Influence of money from wealthy and corporations on politics&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Middle Class: Income inequality, minimum wage of $15, union membership&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Economy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Health care&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Higher Education&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Climate Change&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Criminal Justice Reform&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Immigration Reform&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Protecting the Vulnerable&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Corporate Media&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
stand together to defeat the drift toward oligarchy and create a vibrant democracy&lt;br /&gt;
democracy should be easy&lt;br /&gt;
getting involved, being active in the political process, knowing your voice matters in helping shape the future of your community, state, and country should be the essence of our way of life&lt;br /&gt;
page 185&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
all people, regardless of income, can participate in the political process&lt;br /&gt;
all people can run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy&lt;br /&gt;
candidates should not tell billionaires what they can do for them in exchange for large contributions&lt;br /&gt;
page 204&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
candidates discuss the ideas of the working, middle class, low-income, elderly, children, sick, poor to improve lives for all people&lt;br /&gt;
page ??&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
democracy = one person, one vote&lt;br /&gt;
equal opportunity for those who seek public office&lt;br /&gt;
wealthy shouldn't have undue influence over the election process&lt;br /&gt;
voting and participating in the political process is as easy and convenient as possible&lt;br /&gt;
do not erect barriers to prevent groups of citizens to exercise their right to participate.&lt;br /&gt;
poor, old, young, and people of color should not be discriminated against when they want to vote. Examples: 14, 15, 19, 24, 26th amendment&lt;br /&gt;
page 186&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
voting is a right, not a privilege&lt;br /&gt;
page 187&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
if you work 40 hours or more a week, you do not live in poverty&lt;br /&gt;
page 218&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
living wage should be fair and equitable (equal pay regardless of gender, race, religion, national origin)&lt;br /&gt;
page 228&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
need to make it unprofitable for companies to engage in pay discrimination&lt;br /&gt;
page 231&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
make it easier for workers to join unions&lt;br /&gt;
page 232&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Morals&lt;/h2&gt;
"government has a moral responsibility to provide for the vulnerable -- children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled."&lt;br /&gt;
page 224&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
publicly funded, transparent system of campaign financing&lt;br /&gt;
page 204&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the obscene level of inequality is immoral&lt;br /&gt;
page 208&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Problems to be addressed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
billionaires buying elections&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
governors suppressing the vote by denying poor people or people of color the right to vote&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
page 185&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
small group of extraordinarily wealthy people pump billions of dollars into the political process to buy elections for politicians who will be beholden to them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Republican politicians suppress democracy by making it harder for minorities, poor, elderly, and the young to vote&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
page 189&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics&lt;br /&gt;
page 192&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
making it harder to vote should be illegal&lt;br /&gt;
page 195&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
restore the "preclearance" requirement under section 5 of the voting rights act (protect minority voters)&lt;br /&gt;
expand the scope of the voting rights act so that local authorities cannot prevent free voting&lt;br /&gt;
encourage voter registration&lt;br /&gt;
automatically register every person to vote when they turn 18&lt;br /&gt;
every person who moves to a new state should be registered to vote when the post office has a new address&lt;br /&gt;
Election day should be a federal holiday&lt;br /&gt;
spread election day over a two-day weekend&lt;br /&gt;
enable early voting&lt;br /&gt;
make absentee ballots freely available&lt;br /&gt;
page 196&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ensure their are sufficient polling places and poll workers to prevent long lines from forming&lt;br /&gt;
ensure paper ballots exist for counting and can be audited&lt;br /&gt;
page 197&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
overturn, through constitutional amendment, Citizens United&lt;br /&gt;
overturn, through constitutional amendment, 1976 Buckley v Valeo (spending money on behalf of a candidate or political party is a form of protected speech)&lt;br /&gt;
overturn 2014 McCutcheon v FEC (removed limits on how much an individual can contribute to a national party and to a candidate's campaign over a 2 year period)&lt;br /&gt;
page 204&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
pass legislation to require wealthy individuals and corporations who make large campaign contributions to disclose where their money is going&lt;br /&gt;
page 204&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
raise (federal) minimum wage to $15/hour&lt;br /&gt;
page 218&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
pass the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. Prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for discussing wages and salaries with their coworkers&lt;br /&gt;
page 231&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Employers must be required to prove that any differences in wages have nothing to do with gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or national origin&lt;br /&gt;
page 231&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
US should have one of the highest voting turnout rates in the world, rather than one of the lowest&lt;br /&gt;
Political consciousness should be high&lt;br /&gt;
People are aware and well informed about major changes faced by the nation&lt;br /&gt;
page 186&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>What makes this time unique?</title>
    <content type='html'>At any given point in the history of the United States of America, events within the proceeding decade could be shown as evidence of the&amp;nbsp;eminent&amp;nbsp;decline. People have lived through worse times -- world wars,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"&gt;economic depressions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States"&gt;eugenics&lt;/a&gt;. What makes the current situation unique?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have ongoing wars, undeclared military actions, torture. Struggles like the anti-Vietnam war protests (1964) and Occupy Wallstreet (2011) are a poor metric. Even domestic wars (Civil war, war of 1812) are not good&amp;nbsp;indicators. Economic bubbles and depressions don't help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is different now compared to previous times in our history is the apathy of the population. A way of measuring this is the popularity of futurism. Is society optimistic about the future? If it were, pop culture would reflect this. Recall comics like Buck Rodgers and television shows like the Jetsons. Although not serious forecasts of the future, they indicate an optimism that the&amp;nbsp;situation&amp;nbsp;will improve. Science fiction as a literary genre still exists, but it is not as popular as it was for young adults. [I'm not advocating the Golden Age fallacy -- there were certainly problems facing society at any given time in the past.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This hypothesis&amp;nbsp;yields&amp;nbsp;a testable claim: a rising society should have elements of futurism in the pop culture.</content>

    <title>inconsistency in the legal system </title>
    <content type='html'>There's no requirement that the legal system be self-consistent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's no requirement that laws reflect the current situation -- there's no age-off process in most jurisdictions (because the cost of continual review is high).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Case law alters legislation, but no one goes back and corrects the legislation, or even cites the case law in legislation. [&lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-old-laws-when-new-laws-are-created-Does-the-old-law-remain-on-the-books-but-is-superseded-by-the-new-law-or-is-the-old-law-deleted-entirely"&gt;citation&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>proportional value of the vote of a single person</title>
    <content type='html'>Suppose the eligible voter population of the United States is a positive integer, X. The concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote"&gt;one person, one vote&lt;/a&gt; in a presidential election means that each person's vote is worth 1/X towards determining the president.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In practice, the distribution of value of votes is not uniform due to the electoral college.</content>

    <title>the current political paradigm is more disruptive due to instability</title>
    <content type='html'>Prior to 2017, my perception of politics is that there were people I agreed with and people I disagreed with. Some politicians told truths, others lied, and I accepted this as a natural state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was comfortable because I could use science to design experiments to validate claims. Multiple participants could make different claims, and we could determine which claims were valid by doing experiments. Although this was rarely put into practice, it was an option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new paradigm is what I'll refer to as "inconsistent lies." The distinction is that previously people told self-consistent lies. These claims could then be invalidated by comparing to facts collected by experiments. A mechanism existed which could drive participants to truth and therefore improvement. In contrast, self-contradiction and inconsistent lies are not suited to experiments and validation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn't the first time this phenomenon has arisen in storytelling. See also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inconsistency+in+the+bible"&gt;inconsistencies in the bible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inconsistency+in+the+koran"&gt;koran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inconsistency+in+the+torah"&gt;torah&lt;/a&gt;. This parallel leads to my belief that the same strategies for dealing with religious arguments may apply to the current political methods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conclusion 1: The distinct emotional distinction between lying and inconsistent lies is that it is no longer possible to use scientific experiments to validate or invalidate lying versus truth&lt;br /&gt;
Conclusion 2: Religion serves as a potential corollary example.</content>

    <title>observed political tactics</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;The purpose of enumerating these tactics is so that when action is taken, it is not wasted&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Have a clear strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responding to the current challenges lets your opponent set the direction&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Don't share the strategy you have&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If your opponents know what you plan, they can counteract it&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reduce the number of choices on an issue to "for" and "against"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"pro-life" and "pro-choice" is an easy dichotomy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Simplistic messages are easier to convey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Abstract and well-reasoned verbose arguments require focused attention and time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Media (mass and social) are drawn to concise emotional stories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Long-form and facts-only stories require focused attention and time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Concise message&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"pro-life" and "pro-choice" are both short&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Appeal to emotion rather than statistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Branding is vital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"right to work" sounds better than "anti-union"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;objective&lt;/i&gt;: Concise emotional branding which aligns to core values and has clear immediate impact on that person&lt;br /&gt;
"right to work" is a great example&lt;br /&gt;
"right to bear arms"/"gun control"&lt;br /&gt;
"illegal aliens"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Counter examples&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>politicians as professional public servants </title>
    <content type='html'>Medical professionals, politicians, law enforcement, teachers, and scientists act in the public interest. Participants for each of these fields self-select. The public expects these professionals will provide a benefit to society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of these professional public servants, politicians are elected. The election provides input from the public of who should negotiate on behalf of the voter. For the other professions, the expert acts on behalf of all of the public.</content>

    <title>conservative satire</title>
    <content type='html'>potential explanations for lack of&amp;nbsp;conservative satire&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of comedian community to select from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personality of conservatives not well suited to comedy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographic bias: comedy clubs are in big cities; big cities are liberal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutional bias: the entertainment industry is run by liberals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;young people seek satire; young people are liberal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liberals prefer uncertainty, conservatives prefer certainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Good satire "punches up": it goes after those in powerful positions who negatively effect society or simply do nothing to positively effect it. Bad satire (and bad comedy in general) "punches down": it attacks the powerless and those who use power for positive purposes. ... Left-leaning politics tend to support those who hold less power than those who hold the most power. ... Right-leaning politics tend to support those who hold the most power." [reddit]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

    <title>Goal is to induce apathy?</title>
    <content type='html'>The current political situation seems to both emotionally provoke the population and simultaneously result in apathy as far as action is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>the role of an intellectual when politics is a theatrical production</title>
    <content type='html'>Previously I thought of politics as a negotiation about topics conducted by politicians for benefit of constituents. I now view &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/10/politics-is-theater-not-negotiation.html"&gt;politics as a production about negotiation&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of influencing two distinct categories of audience: financial backers and voting lay-persons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't feel my new view of politics is negative. Rather, I have an improved understanding which enables more effective action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When engaging with someone on a topic, the goal isn't to change their mind. I focus on providing context for the benefit of the audience. What's the relevant history? What's a useful frame for the issue? What actions are available to the audience?</content>

    <title>what actions would be relevant for change</title>
    <content type='html'>I don't expect that my single vote in an election will make a significant difference. I don't expect that solitary protests are useful.&amp;nbsp; Contacting my elected representatives about issues is of questionable impact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though typical routes to political engagement don't seem attractive to me in terms of impact, I think options exist which could be impactful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I view gerrymandering, campaign finance, the electoral college, and altering the judicial branch makeup to be bad. At the same time, I think taking individual action on any one issue is superficial -- it is unlikely to address underlying differences among participants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if one side manages to change the law or policy, the next time the other party is in power they are motivated to undo that change. Therefore, seeking to change laws does not alter society in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This line of reasoning leads me to believe that the most effective long-term strategy for political change and societal change is to alter social norms expected by members of the society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Changing norms rather than laws is a grandiose interest. How to accomplish this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-i-tackle-root-cause-analysis.html"&gt;this outline&lt;/a&gt; as a guide, one aspect to tackle is the reasoning used in arguments. For example, gerrymandering, campaign finance, the electoral college all seem counter to representative democracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The underlying motivation for my actions is that I desire to live in a state that operates as a representative democracy. That's why gerrymandering and voting and campaign finance matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next step is to take this perspective into conversation with people who disagree.</content>

    <title>Handbook for changing culture</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Observations&lt;/i&gt;: There are lots of problems. You are not that smart. You lack experience. And you want your voice heard. You may be willing to participate in a process or even do some work, but that's not common.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, identify which behaviors are desired and are undesirable. (This is in contrast to a deliverable, outcome, product,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"&gt;KPI&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three aspects to evaluate: policy/law, individuals, and incentives.</content>

    <title>initial foray into thinking about politics: dead cats</title>
    <content type='html'>Here's what spurred my thinking:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/trumps-reality-distortion-field/"&gt;http://www.wnyc.org/story/trumps-reality-distortion-field/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that I know the jargon, it's easier to find:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-dead-cats_us_583da465e4b04e28cf5b8bb2"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-dead-cats_us_583da465e4b04e28cf5b8bb2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.scotwork.com/blog/posts/2015/dead-cat-tactic/"&gt;http://www.scotwork.com/blog/posts/2015/dead-cat-tactic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm observing that lies are creating information instability. What is the most effective&amp;nbsp;way to respond to this tactic?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, I think it's useful to know who your current politicians are. Name, position, biography. To find out who are my elected officials (full chain of command), see&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://act.commoncause.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sunlight_advocacy_list_page"&gt;http://act.commoncause.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sunlight_advocacy_list_page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://whoismyrepresentative.com/search/zip/21228"&gt;http://whoismyrepresentative.com/search/zip/21228&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; only does congress&lt;br /&gt;
What's their history?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://votesmart.org/"&gt;http://votesmart.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; poor interface for results list&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
********************&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; margin: 0px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-decoration-color: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"&gt;
2) what issues are each politician current facing?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, determine what the effective channels for taking action are.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vote, both locally and nationally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you registered to vote?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is the next vote? Where?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the issues and who are the candidates for each office?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phone calls to voice either support or "no." Mention that you are a registered active voter in the party of the politician you are calling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the politician's name appears in mass media (newspaper, TV), they pay attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Citations for phone being the preferred channel:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://billmoyers.com/2012/12/26/do-politicians-read-the-emails-you-send-them/"&gt;http://billmoyers.com/2012/12/26/do-politicians-read-the-emails-you-send-them/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://techpresident.com/files/AdvocacyGap-ResearchReport.pdf"&gt;http://techpresident.com/files/AdvocacyGap-ResearchReport.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There are also ineffective channels for communicating with politicians:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email, tweets, letters, Facebook posts get ignored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demonstrations/protests: not clear what actions result. ["It's a process, not a moment."]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== future ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
know who funds your candidate&lt;br /&gt;
Example (prediction): Cory Booker (D) will be held up as a hot candidate, but he's bad on education and healthcare&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who has what incentives? Who has vision?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== complexity of issues ==&lt;br /&gt;
Q: given multiple issues, what's the root cause and what actions impact those issues?&lt;br /&gt;
A: listen to Bernie Sander's speeches, read his book. He analyzes the issues: Income inequality, prison reform, campaign finance, health care, education, climate change&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; small donations to advocacy groups (ie ACLU, Planned Parenthood)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== reading recommendations ==&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.indivisibleguide.com/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== jargon ==&lt;br /&gt;
* corporate democrat&lt;br /&gt;
* neolibral&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we can predict the future, then we can brainstorm actions that would alter the future.&lt;br /&gt;
Establishing a vision is vital to steer actions.</content>

    <title>How I tackle root cause analysis</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the language used for the issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in language among the factions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can a common language be created that stakeholders can use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify who matters. Not everyone is equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each person, determine their motives/interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is their mindset? How do they perceive the system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the history -- what was the evolution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What has been tried previously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why has action been taken? What are the road blocks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify what decisions are relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify timelines for activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather quantitative data to measure the system as it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create cost/benefit models that use the measurements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine a better solution, accounting for the stakeholders, users, costs, history, motives/interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share this vision with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate to determine a plan, delegate actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layer moral imperatives and emotional language atop the quantitative models informed by measurement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>politics is theater, not negotiation</title>
    <content type='html'>In an earlier post, I had concluded that &lt;a href="https://whataction.blogspot.com/2017/10/what-is-politics-and-governance.html"&gt;politics was negotiation&lt;/a&gt;. Based on my background in negotiation, I thought I would be able to meaningfully contribute to the situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I now think politics is theater, played for the audience of citizens. The topic of the play is negotiation, but it is not the same as negotiation carried out in private. Instead, the negotiation is carried out as a spectacle for the consumption by the public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With my original view of politics as negotiation, I thought that facts, measurements, and experiments mattered in that they supported a specific conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that politics is a theatrical presentation of negotiation helps explain why facts are just another tool in the actor's toolbox of available methods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The old paradigm of lying about the facts is perfectly reasonable -- it's an alternative play put on by actors to convince the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new paradigm of lies being inconsistent is a new tactic. It's a way of driving the conversation.

    <title>lazy liberal theory that demographics will win in the medium term</title>
    <content type='html'>Theory of the lazy liberal: the demographics of the United States will shift to be majority non-white. Then the Democrats will be in power. There's an implicit Assumption of a Level Playing Field and equally energetic voters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two counter arguments:&lt;br /&gt;
The minority white population may be more politically energetic and the non white majority may be politically inactive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rules governing political interaction may selectively benefit the white population or may be detrimental to non whites</content>

    <title>start with utopia, then what?</title>
    <content type='html'>Suppose that the electoral college were eliminated, financial reforms were implemented, and gerrymandering were eliminated. (Similarly for health care, etc)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What would prevent humans from changing the rules to benefit their side?&lt;br /&gt;
Principles and motives need to be accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;
Accounting for principles and motivation may lead to a novel attack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People are interested in stories about characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In normal conversation, people typically don't present ideas with the intention of being rebutted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of our perspective is based on emotional arguments we heard from other people. Our direct experience is anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;
Statistically relevant and quantifiably precise data takes a lot of work and attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a problem is identified, the naive impulse is to apply the simplest idea. Considering potential second order effects is not standard.</content>

    <title>strategies that work for influencing congress</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify who influences the topic you are focused on -- committee memberships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the agenda for that committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify constituents for the relevant committee member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notify constituents about the specific topic, the timeline, who they should contact, and what message needs to be delivered. Provide templates, but prefer personal stories that impact the individual voter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;determine if congress-person is making public appearances where people can voice their concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow-up with the congress-person by a local lobbyist in DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type='html'>Scientific democracy was my naive realization that it would be possible to improve upon the current paradigm. It also led me to understand that any meaningful change would be challenging to cause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Voters think changing politicians will result in change; this is consistent with the aspect they have input on.&lt;br /&gt;
Leading politicians argue for changing laws. This is consistent with the aspect they have a voice in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Claim: Altering laws and altering who approves policy changes are second order consequences&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First order: What causes policy makers to change paradigms?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While i am currently unable to answer that, there is a potentially relevant related question: What are ways to alter an individual's paradigm?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moral argument&lt;br /&gt;
Emotional argument&lt;br /&gt;
Logical argument&lt;br /&gt;
Experiential basis&lt;br /&gt;
Shifting the social norm/expectation&lt;br /&gt;
Financial incentive&lt;br /&gt;
Quid pro quo&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the above approaches, there are different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* Individual&lt;br /&gt;
* Family - nepotism&amp;nbsp; (favoritism)&lt;br /&gt;
* Community - nationalism&amp;nbsp; (favoritism)&lt;br /&gt;
* Humanity&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Individualism doesn’t scale well for me.&lt;br /&gt;
Tribal arguments (ie nationalism, family) are weak for me. "Humanity" is too broad for most people.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>cultural priming yields the current scenario</title>
    <content type='html'>How did we end up with an emotionally-driven reactive leader?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our entertainment culture is financially motivated to provide consumers with emotionally stimulating content. Therefore, we expect other aspects of our lives to be similarly stimulating. Otherwise the input is boring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have little motivation for and few examples of delayed gratification. A bit of upfront suffering or work with the possibility of satisfaction in the long term.</content>

    <title>facts versus emotion in politics -- what's the basis?</title>
    <content type='html'>I initially naively thought that politics was a debate using facts in order progress the country towards a better status, both locally and globally. My explanation for rhetoric (rather than logic) was that facts were being spun in order to win emotional weight of the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My view has evolved. The assumption that participants start from facts does not seem to apply to politics. Instead, start with an emotional state, determine a desired outcome, then figure out how to best reach that (regardless of method).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In retrospect, the basis being emotional rather than facts and logic is consistent with the human brain. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system"&gt;limbic system&lt;/a&gt; is the core and is old; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; is an add-on and is new (on an evolutionary time-scale).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn't a rationalization that emotions should govern politics (or any other subject).</content>

    <title>self, partners, friends, associates, tribe, world</title>
    <content type='html'>Humans may live in large-scale societies which exceed the size of tribes we spent much of our evolutionary history in, but we still act and think using the basis of tribes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tribe has a set of shared assumptions, values, and goals. The people making up your tribe are your partners, friends, some coworkers, and associates you repeatedly encounter. You can exist in multiple tribes; these are more commonly referred to as social circles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are abstractions that are larger than tribes -- the workforce of a large corporation, a state, a large political party, nation, or fans of a popular sports team. These abstractions are meaningful in that actions result from interactions at that scale, but we humans haven't evolved with these structures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason these large-scale abstractions are possible is because of communication. Prior to modern technology, the "anyone-to-many" communication was limited to shouting at a crowd (ie speeches, preaching) and posters/notices/books. One-to-one was constrained to verbal communication and writing letters; later the telegram. Crossing tribal boundaries took work and cost money.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the advent of radio and then TV, a limited number of people were enabled to easily perform one-to-many communication across tribal boundaries. The phone allowed for one-to-one communication at a lower cost than telegrams for the same bandwidth. These modern technologies started the trend towards lower-cost communication for one-to-many and one-to-one communication.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the past few decades, blogs and streaming video (ie YouTube) have enabled anyone-to-many communication. Review sites like Yelp provide many-to-one communication. The cost of one-to-one has plummeted with services like texting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As cost decrease and bandwidth increases, the level of significance in the communication decreases. Less thought is invested because the cost of sending content is trivial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Creating technology and associated infrastructure is costly. The motivation for spending money is expected profit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a consequence of this progress, communication across tribal boundaries is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>superficial emotional persuasion</title>
    <content type='html'>I used to think progress was by cost/benefit evaluation of the options.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I observed the merit of negotiation from principles. This was an emotional basis that used facts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I've realized that, in addition to debate being more emotional than factual, the emotional basis for most opinions are superficial. There's a lack of deep emotional principles that form the basis of interactions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Superficial versus principled: how did you arrive at your current opinion? Superficial = I heard a few sound bites that were persuasive, but I don't know most relevant facts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Superficial emotional reasoning can still be passionate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Passion manifests as anger, excitement, focus, joyousness, and obsession. Not being passionate is melancholy, anxious, and exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a consequence of having opinions based on superficial emotions, the individual is more susceptible to rhetorical tactics.&lt;br /&gt;

Vision. Simply put, ask "Where do I see the world in 100 years?" If there aren't catastrophic interruptions, will the United States be a&amp;nbsp;theocracy? A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"&gt;panopticon&lt;/a&gt;? How would you define your utopia?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/WjVHvC9EeB4"&gt;http://youtu.be/WjVHvC9EeB4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My goals for good government are to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce the suffering of the populace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enable pursuit of happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Notice the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" captures this well. The inability to put this into practice is that it is difficult to agree how exactly to. Secondly, the populace wants government to be efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any discussion, all parties must agree upon the goals for the group, the definitions of the terms used to describe the goals, and what limits are in effect.&amp;nbsp;Terms which need definition: life, liberty (freedom). "Life" is an important term as we will need to determine what it is that is being protected. "Liberty" to do what and how?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of starting from a very general definition, let's start with something everyone agrees upon; a very specific case. For instance, a 43 year old working at the hardware store in town. What does "life" mean in this case? How is this person distinct from a stalk of corn?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that I've already tried to avoid including sex, religion, ethnicity in my example. This is because I think these aspects are irrelevant to having life. Age and the ability to do work will play a role. The reason is that a 43 year old person has already left their mother's w&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;omb and since they are working has not yet died. Since a person is not always alive, this implies two phase transitions: (1) not-born to alive, then (2) alive to dead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;The "easier" case of death can be defined as "heart not beating&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20px;"&gt;autonomically for &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; time."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 20px;"&gt;The other transition, born to alive, is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 20px;"&gt;contentious due to the question of abortion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 20px;"&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>methods in rhetoric: honesty, lying, and confusion</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Options in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factual reasoning or&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotional reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consistent lies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;counter-factual reasoning or&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotional reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-contradictory lies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inconsistent counter-factual reasoning or&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;situationally-dependent emotional reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We have experience with truth (and spin), and with consistent lies. For consistent lies the response is to point out how the story differs from reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The same tactic, pointing out how the story differs from reality, applied to self-contradictory lies is not productive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One reference to the rhetorical method of self-contradictory lies is the April 2015 post&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.scotwork.com/negotiation-blog/2015/dead-cat-tactic"&gt;http://www.scotwork.com/negotiation-blog/2015/dead-cat-tactic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Method was also described&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/trumps-reality-distortion-field/"&gt;https://www.wnyc.org/story/trumps-reality-distortion-field/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
which was aired &lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/on-the-media-2017-01-13/"&gt;Jan 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The article references Putin advisor &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov"&gt;Vladislav Surkov&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;"Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering constantly changing piece of theater... It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused."&lt;br /&gt;
"Surkov has this term called "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_democracy"&gt;managed democracy&lt;/a&gt;." We maintain the right to express a preference for one policy or another but in a managed democracy, in Surkov’s view, we don't have any impact on the formation of that policy."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's not clear to me how to address&amp;nbsp;movement of the U.S. towards &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism"&gt;inverted totalitarianism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>emotionally resonant stories</title>
    <content type='html'>What's the difference between rationalization and science?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a difference between rationalization and hypothesis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4"&gt;HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known&lt;/a&gt;) "is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses." More simply, rationalization tells a story about observations after the data is collected. In contrast, a scientific hypothesis is tested by carefully designing an experiment to collect data. The initial hypothesis is informed by experience (previous data).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans seek emotionally resonant stories to explain their environment. Rationalization takes less work than developing a hypothesis and testing it in an experiment. However, there is a long term cost to using incorrect stories that result from rationalization.</content>

    <title>vision, strategy, tactics, stories are all independent aspects</title>
    <content type='html'>I thought that vision, strategy, tactics, and emotionally resonant stories all had to align. Conservatives accomplished their objectives with these four things aspects being disjoint.&lt;br /&gt;
--&amp;gt; People who support the vision don't need to agree with the emotionally resonant stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Separate the means (stories) from the end (vision).</content>

    <title>Prediction: A new war within two years (by 2019)</title>
    <content type='html'>Given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon"&gt;Steve Bannon&lt;/a&gt;'s vision, roles, proximity to power, and influence on national direction, I predict war within two years (by 2019).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Minimum number of troops to qualify:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Officially declared?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*********************&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Update: it felt both re-assuring and disheartening to find the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZOF9q5fzfs"&gt;Saturday Night Live opening skit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;Feb 5, 2017 was on this topic. Re-assuring to find that other people had drawn a similar conclusion; disheartening that is apparently expected.</content>
